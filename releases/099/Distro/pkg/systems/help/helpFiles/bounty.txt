<I>How does it work?</I><BR>
<BR>
When you are killed, all other players that participated in the attack may be reported for the murder. If reported, everyone will have the possibility to place a bounty for the head with the command:
<BR>
<BR>
.placeBounty
<BR>
<BR>
Bounties may not exceed the total amount of gold in your backpack.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<I>How do I collect a bounty?</I><BR>
<BR>
You may return the head of another player to any town guard. The guard will check to see if a bounty exists for the head that was returned, and award a bounty straight to your bank box.
<BR>
<BR>
<I>If I get a bounty, will it stick around forever?</I><BR>
<BR>
All bounties expire 1 week after placement. If you dont incurr any additional bounties and/or murders within that week period, then your bounty will be removed from the list, and guards will not reward any bounties on your head. Once a bounty is claimed, it will be removed from the list.

<BR>
<I>Are there any penalties for having a bounty on my head?</I><BR>
<BR>
Currently there are no penalties except the greed of other players. >:]
