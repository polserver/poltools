For more than a hundred centuries the Lord of Darkness has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of Fantasia. He is the master of mankind by the will of the gods and master of a million lands by the might of his inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibily with power from the Dark Age of Magery. He is the Carrion Lord of Britannia for whom a thousand souls die every day, for whom blood is drunk and flesh eaten. Blood and Flesh: the stuff of which Fantasia Shard is made.

To be playing here in such times is to be one amongst untold others. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. This is the tale of those times. It is a universe you can live in today ( if you dare ) for this is a dark and terrible era where you will find little comfort or hope. If you want to take part in the adventure then prepare yourself now. Forget the power of technology, science and common humanity. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for there is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter and the laughter of thirsting gods.

But the universe is a big place and, whatever happens, you will not be missed...
