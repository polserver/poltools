# Purpose:
# Defines Portions of the response when using Arms Lore skill.
#
# Structure:

# {
#    [Damage	(% Condition)	(Phrase)]
# }
#
# Explanation
# Be sure to use a TAB between Condition and phrase. The script uses this in order
# to seperate them when it reads all the elements.
# Phrase defines the UNIQUE name for this condition level. The condition is looked at as
# if the target's condition is below the defined amount but higher than others that are
# defined.
