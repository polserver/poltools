# movecost.cfg: used by core to calculate movement costs based on
#               carrying capacity and weight carried
#
#               the first value is the percentage of carrying capacity
#               carried; the second is the multiplier for movement cost
#
#               intermediate values are interpolated linearly.
#
# Edit this file with care -- there's not a lot of error checking
