InS20:the former, phonemesS19:combine into largerS15:words which mayS20:contain full phrasalS12:significanceS14:In the second,S18:prefixing specificS15:phonetic soundsS22:changes the subject ofS17:the sentence intoS22:object, interrogative,S21:addressed individual,S10:or dinner.S20:Agglutination occursS20:whenever four of theS15:same letter areS21:present in a word, inS19:which case, any twoS14:of them may beS19:removed or slurred.S17:Pitch changes theS16:phoneme value ofS21:individual syllables,S15:thus completelyS20:altering what a wordS13:may mean. TheS18:classic example isS13:AktgluthugrotS11:bigglogubuuS22:dargilgaglug lublublubS18:which can mean YouS17:are such a prettyS19:girl, My mother ateS18:your primroses, orS21:Jellyfish nose paintsS12:alms potato,S19:depending on pitch.S19:Orcish poetry oftenS21:relies upon repeatingS18:the same phrase inS22:multiple pitches, evenS14:changing pitchS16:midword. None ofS17:this great art isS13:translatable.S19:The orcish languageS18:uses the followingS23:vowels: ab, ad, ag, aktS22:at, augh, auh, azh, e,S20:i, o, oo, u, uu. TheS20:vowel sound a is notS21:recognized as a vowelS21:and does not exist inS15:their alphabet.S22:The orcish alphabet isS22:best learned using theS13:classic rhymeS14:repeated at 23S18:different pitches:S15:Lugnog ghu blatS12:suggaroglug,S17:Gaghbuu dakdar abS9:highugbo,S14:Gothnogbuim adS15:gilgubbugbuilugS20:Bilgeaugh thurggulg.S18:Translation of theS1: S1: S12:first pitch:S19:Eat food, the firstS13:letter is ab,S17:Kill people, nextS13:letter is ad,S17:I forget the restS20:But augh is in thereS10:somewhere!S17:What follows is aS17:complete phoneticS21:library of the orcishS9:language:S21:ab, ad, ag, akt, alm,S19:at, augh, auh, azh,S22:ba, ba, bag, bar, baz,S15:bid, bilge, bo,S19:bog, bog, brui, bu,S21:buad, bug, bug, buil,S21:buim, bum, buo, buor,S19:buu, ca, car, clog,S18:cro, cuk, cur, da,S21:dagh, dagh, dak, dar,S20:deak, der, dil, dit,S14:dor, dre, dri,S18:dru, du, dud, duf,S19:dug, dug, duh, dun,S21:eag, eg, egg, eichel,S19:ek, ep, ewk, faugh,S19:fid, flu, fog, foo,S19:foz, fruk, fu, fub,S19:fud, fun, fup, fur,S20:gaa, gag, gagh, gan,S19:gar, gh, gha, ghat,S21:ghed, ghig, gho, ghu,S19:gig, gil, gka, glu,S20:glu, glug, gna, gno,S20:gnu, gol, gom, goth,S21:grunt, grut, gu, gub,S20:gub, gug, gug, gugh,S9:guk, guk.

Yet whatS23:is it within the peopleS22:of our land that sortsS21:out the good from theS19:evil, the cherishedS19:from the disdained?S20:Virtue, I say it is,S17:and virtue is theS20:logical outcome of aS18:people who wish toS18:live together in aS15:bonded society.S1: S19:For without VirtuesS20:as a code of conductS21:which people maintainS23:in their relations withS22:each other, the fabricS20:of that society willS20:become weakened. ForS21:a society to grow andS21:prosper for all, eachS21:must grant the othersS16:a common base ofS14:consideration.S20:I call this base theS19:Virtues. For thoughS21:one person might gainS1: S22:breaching such a code,S22:the society as a wholeS13:would suffer.S15:There are threeS22:Principle Virtues thatS22:should guide people toS20:enlightenment. TheseS21:personal advantage byS21:Courage. From all theS20:infinite reasons oneS20:may have to found anS21:action, such as greedS19:or charity, envy orS15:pity, the threeS17:Principle VirtuesS10:stand out.S17:In fact all otherS21:virtues and vices canS20:be shown to be builtS21:from these principlesS18:and their oppositeS15:corruption's ofS21:Falsehood, Hatred andS16:Cowardice. TheseS20:three Principles canS20:be combined in eightS18:ways, which I willS23:call the eight virtues.S17:The eight virtuesS15:which we shouldS22:build our society uponS7:follow.S19:Truth alone becomesS20:Honesty, for withoutS19:honesty between ourS18:people, how can weS21:build the trust whichS21:is needed to maximizeS14:our successes.S18:Love alone becomesS18:compassion, for atS20:some time or anotherS23:all of us will need theS21:compassion of others,S15:and most likelyS18:compassion will beS18:shown to those whoS14:have shown it.S13:Courage aloneS14:becomes Valor,S17:without valor ourS17:people will neverS14:reach into theS17:unknown or to theS20:risky and will neverS8:achieve.S17:Truth tempered byS22:Love gives us Justice,S18:for only in lovingS20:search for the truthS21:can one dispense fairS20:Justice, rather thanS17:create a cold andS15:callous people.S16:Love and CourageS19:gives us Sacrifice,S21:for a people who loveS18:each other will beS15:willing to makeS22:personal sacrifices toS20:help others in need,S1: S17:needed in return.S17:Courage and TruthS20:give us Honor, greatS17:knights know thisS20:well, that chivalricS21:honor can be found byS21:adhering to this codeS21:which one day, may beS16:Combining Truth,S16:Love and CourageS21:suggest the virtue ofS23:Spirituality the virtueS21:that causes one to beS17:introspective, toS17:wonder about onesS23:place in this world andS19:whether one's deedsS21:will be recorded as aS22:gift to the world or aS7:plague.S19:The final Virtue isS21:more complicated. ForS22:the eighth combinationS17:is that devoid ofS22:Truth, Love or CourageS20:which can only existS19:in a state of greatS15:Pride, which ofS22:course is not a virtueS20:at all. Perhaps thisS23:trick of fate is a testS17:to see if one canS21:realize that the trueS17:virtue is that ofS21:Humility. I feel thatS22:the people of MaginciaS24:fail to see this to suchS21:a degree that I wouldS19:not be surprised ifS21:some ill fate awaitedS13:their future.S13:Thus from theS22:infinite possibilitiesS17:which spawned theS19:Three Principles ofS15:Truth, Love andS17:Courage, come theS16:Eight Virtues ofS20:Honesty, Compassion,S15:Valor, Justice,S17:Sacrifice, Honor,S16:Spirituality andS9:Humility.S1: S1: S1:

To wit, givenS18:the postulate thatS21:matter within a givenS20:dimension may be butS17:a cros-section ofS20:ethereal matter thatS18:exists in multipleS14:dimensions, itS20:becomes obvious thatS13:said etherealS22:structure cannot enterS19:dimensions in whichS22:it is already present.S10:Imagine anS19:individual (and theS15:Lord BlackthornS22:hinted that he was oneS15:such) who existS20:already in some formS11:in multipleS16:dimensions: saidS20:individual would notS21:be able to cross intoS17:another dimensionS13:because HE ISS14:ALREADY THERE.S19:The implications ofS20:this are staggering,S17:and merit furtherS16:study. 'Tis wellS21:known by theorists inS14:the field thatS16:divisions in theS21:ethereal structure ofS17:an individual areS19:already implicit atS22:the temporal level, asS16:causality forcesS18:divisions upon theS18:ether. This is theS15:basic operatingS18:mechanism by whichS15:white moongatesS20:function, permittingS12:time travel.S21:As time travel is notS13:barred by theS22:presence of an earlierS12:self (thoughS17:encountering saidS22:earlier self can proveS19:arcanely perilous),S18:there must be someS15:rigidity to theS23:ethereal structure thatS13:bars multipleS14:instantiationsS18:of structures fromS18:manifesting withinS17:the same context.S19:If one regards timeS22:and causal bifurcationS21:as a web, perhaps theS19:appropriate analogyS15:for dimensionalS21:matrices is that of aS21:crystalline structureS20:with rigid linkages.S15:The only way inS19:which an individualS12:such as LordS15:Blackthorn, whoS18:exists in multipleS21:dimensional matrices,S22:can cross worlds via aS21:black moongate, wouldS17:be for the entireS21:crystalline structureS19:of the dimension toS19:perfectly match theS21:ethereal resonance ofS15:the destinationS10:dimension.S14:The problem ofS11:why certainS15:individuals areS21:already replicated inS20:multiple crystallineS22:matrices is one that IS19:fail to provide anyS19:schema for in theseS20:poor theories. It isS20:my fondest hope thatS15:someday someoneS18:shall conquer thatS18:thorny problem andS20:enlighten the world.S1: S1:

Her nameS18:was Leyla and thatS22:spring I had held fondS21:dreams of holding herS16:hand and sharingS18:flavored ice whileS21:dangling our feet offS19:the small bridge byS15:Smugglers Gate.S18:And I said nothingS16:when they caughtS19:her and did not cryS21:out when they draggedS20:her off through thatS19:breach in our wall,S20:and did not warn theS19:city when I saw theS21:helmeted orc captainsS20:call the charge uponS13:the mansions.S19:Blame me not, for IS19:was but a child andS18:one who hid in theS21:branches of the peachS20:trees, all a-trembleS20:whilst I watched theS20:smoke rise from SeanS21:the tailor's and fireS23:lash out at the roof ofS16:witchy Eleanor'sS7:tavern.S18:To this day I haveS21:had no word of Leyla,S19:and to this day theS21:smell of burning woodS20:can conjure terribleS20:dreams.

First and mostS21:obvious is the amountS18:of damage that theS21:weapon may do againstS18:unprotected flesh.S20:While 'tis this thatS18:first attracts theS23:attention of the noviceS21:'tis a deadly mistakeS19:to regard it as theS23:sole value of a weapon.S18:While it may proveS23:devastating indeed as aS16:means of causingS16:damage, a weaponS18:must also serve asS17:stout shield whenS18:engaged in combat.S16:Hence the secondS21:issue to which to payS23:attention is the amountS20:of protection that aS17:weapon may offer.S22:Pay close attention toS22:the guard on it, if itS18:be a blade, or theS22:stoutness of it's woodS19:if it is a polearm.S22:Oft related to this isS21:the wait of a weapon,S21:for a heavy weapon isS17:more difficult toS17:maneuver to blockS22:with, though it may doS19:more damage to theyS21:opponent. If a weaponS20:is too heavy for theS18:wielder to move itS19:freely, they shouldS22:choose another and notS22:attempt to prove theirS19:prowess by the sizeS15:of their sword.S16:The reach of theS20:weapon both increaseS22:its defensive ability,S19:and renders it moreS21:useful in open spacesS19:as it allows attackS20:against the opponentS19:without the need toS22:close. But be aware ofS22:the limitations of thyS20:weapon! For a weaponS20:with great reach mayS19:be useless in closeS20:quarter, for lack ofS21:space to maneuver it.S11:Should thatS15:dagger-wieldingS19:enemy close on theeS22:and they halberd, 'tisS13:best to flee.S21:Lastly, a factor thatS14:must always beS17:considered is theS16:condition of theS21:weapon. It might be aS16:wondrous magicalS19:blade of surpassingS20:sharpness and it mayS19:leap to block blowsS18:with a mind of itsS21:own. It also might beS14:of such flimsyS16:construction, orS18:damaged to such anS22:extent, that the firstS22:time it clangs againstS21:steel, 'twill shatterS20:into useless shards.S14:Seek ye a goodS17:blacksmith shouldS18:they weapon becomeS21:damaged, but be awareS10:that theirS17:ministrations mayS15:simply make theS13:matter worse.S14:While mages ofS23:some ability oft createS15:magical weaponsS20:which enhance skill,S19:are preternaturallyS20:sharp, or incinerateS17:the enemy as theyS17:fall, to mind theS23:greatest gift that theyS17:can grant a stoutS19:sword is to make itS20:resistant to damage,S22:for they own skill canS11:make up theS18:difference. ExceptS21:for the fireball, butS16:if the corpse isS21:charred, then so willS19:be the possessions,S20:which maketh lootingS10:difficult!S1: S1: S1:

	contents a192:S18:Societies oft haveS15:common codes ofS16:conduct which itS22:expects all its peopleS23:to abide by. Now, whileS23:'tis true that this canS10:offer someS19:advantages, most ofS21:the codes I see todayS21:around Britannia haveS19:fatal flaws. Let usS13:examine them.S15:First, there isS20:Blackthorn's code ofS18:Chaos or basicallyS16:Anarchy. WhereasS16:this affords theS18:individual maximumS15:opportunity forS22:individuality and evenS19:pursuit of personalS22:happiness, it does notS16:offer even basicS21:interpersonal conductS23:codes to prevent peopleS17:from killing eachS6:other.S18:Without such basicS22:tenets, all the peopleS20:will need to spend aS22:significant portion ofS21:their time and effortS16:towards personalS19:protection and thusS17:less time towardsS21:other more beneficialS9:pursuits.S18:Then there are theS23:moral codes that are soS20:popular today. TheseS23:codes are built largelyS23:on historical traditionS19:rather than currentS23:logic and thus are alsoS15:antiquated. ForS18:example many moralS18:codes we see todayS18:include statementsS24:about not eating certainS20:foods that once wereS20:often poisonous, butS21:today can be preparedS7:safely.S11:Many forbidS21:contact between youngS22:people of the oppositeS20:gender, which can inS22:fact be hazardous; butS20:the codes often haveS22:lost the context as toS17:why this is done,S22:instead merely callingS22:it amoral. In this dayS22:and age to call that aS15:necessary moralS16:would need a newS22:reasoning. I put forthS21:that tradition is notS7:enough.S19:Then there are LordS21:British's Virtues. ItS21:strikes me that whileS22:a system of virtues isS14:wonderful as aS21:touchstone to guide aS15:society to goodS19:behavior, these areS17:but shades of theS22:underlying truth as toS19:why one may wish toS24:live a life according toS16:certain rules ofS8:conduct.S18:On the other hand,S19:clearly the VirtuesS22:that I have heard LordS20:British speak of areS22:clearly positive codesS22:of conduct, far betterS17:than the world ofS17:anarchy that LordS20:Blackthorn suggests.S18:Yet, are not theseS21:Virtues still derivedS13:from a set ofS16:principles whichS17:though they soundS22:good, are difficult toS19:pin down as actual,S20:undeniable, rationalS8:truths?,S16:Worse yet thoughS17:imagine a societyS21:who's code of conductS17:was based on pureS15:survival of theS21:strongest. While thisS20:society may functionS19:and even accomplishS22:much, it can be fairlyS20:argued that personalS15:happiness wouldS21:suffer greatly exceptS24:for those at the top. ToS14:rule that out,S16:however, we mustS18:first believe thatS22:people have a right toS17:pursue happiness.S16:I hope is a safeS19:assumption that allS17:beings wish to beS21:happy; I will broadlyS16:describe this asS21:Hedonism. Yet, if allS25:people did is live a lifeS18:of hedonism, theirS20:hedonism might be inS19:conflict with thoseS20:near them, so I willS22:use the term Ethics toS19:describe limits oneS18:might put on one'sS21:hedonistic tendenciesS18:to allow others toS12:pursue theirS18:happiness as well.S16:Allow me to giveS20:this example: If oneS23:were to live alone on aS22:desert isle, one couldS19:live a life of pureS16:hedonism, for noS21:action one might takeS20:could interfere withS18:another's right toS12:pursue theirS21:happiness. Poison theS23:lake if you like, thereS22:is no one to blame butS9:yourself!S18:Now suppose two ofS24:you live on that island.S18:Thou dost not wantS20:thy neighbor to feelS24:free to poison the lake.S22:Would it not be betterS24:to consider it unethicalS18:to poison the lakeS22:without first thinkingS14:of those whoseS20:pursuit of happinessS20:might be affected byS13:this action?,S22:I put forth that it isS21:the fact that we as aS24:people choose to live inS17:groups known as aS22:society that causes usS17:to compromise ourS18:pure hedonism withS1: S22:Likewise we accept notS18:being able to killS22:others without reason,S15:because our ownS20:pursuit of happinessS16:would be greatlyS21:interfered with if weS19:feared others wouldS18:do the same to us.S18:From this basis ofS19:logic can be formedS21:the Tenets of EthicalS9:Hedonism.S16:For more on thisS16:subject, see theS18:Tenants of EthicalS20:Hedonism, by RichardS19:Garriott and HermanS7:Miller.S1:

HereinS22:discover those secretsS20:which I have learnedS20:over the years as anS20:itinerant performer.S13:Once I was inS21:Jhelom and accidentlyS20:angered the bravo ofS18:some local repute,S21:whose blade flickeredS20:all too eagerly nearS22:my slender neck (for IS16:was young then).S21:After various threatsS17:to ruin my prettyS15:face this bravoS19:grabbed my arm in aS13:most unseemlyS21:fashion and tossed meS15:into a barbaricS17:enclosure locallyS23:entitled a dueling pit.S22:My plaintive cries forS18:help went unheededS22:by the guards, for theS21:inhabitants of JhelomS19:are eager indeed toS16:measure fightingS20:prowess at any time!S17:What saved me wasS14:the ability toS18:improvise a melodyS23:and tune that satirizedS19:the proceedings andS20:sufficiently angeredS19:an onlooker to prodS19:him to coming to myS18:defense. Once thatS20:fight was underway IS21:was able to make goodS19:my escape. Hence, IS21:regard the ability toS16:incite fights asS20:indispensable to theS13:prudent bard.S12:Upon anotherS19:occasion, 'twas theS20:obverse side of thatS19:coin which saved meS20:for I was being heldS13:prisoner by aS18:particularly nastyS20:band of ruffians whoS13:had seized meS17:unawares from theS15:road to Vesper.S15:They had workedS17:themselves into aS15:frenzy and wereS21:ready to attack and IS18:fear, tear me limbS17:from limb, when IS13:began to singS20:frantically, tappingS18:my fallen drum witS20:my tied up feet. TheS21:melody developed intoS22:a soothing one and theS15:brigands slowlyS18:calmed down to theS22:extent of apologizing,S19:and they let me go!S17:A final example IS20:would pray you grantS22:your attention: once IS21:was lost upon a largeS23:isle far to the east ofS18:the mainland, wellS22:beyond Serpent's Hold,S19:where lava made itsS19:sluggish way acrossS22:the surface landscape.S17:And this accursedS20:land was filled withS22:vile beats and cunningS8:dragons.S19:I was being pursuedS19:by one of said fellS20:dragons when I foundS17:myself trapped. IS17:quickly skirted aS23:bubbling pool of moltenS21:rock and attempted toS16:hide. The dragonS18:scented me and wasS22:preparing to skirt theS21:pool, when I began toS22:play a lusty tune uponS22:my lute that attractedS14:its attention.S14:Mesmerized andS22:enticed by the melody,S19:it stepped directlyS19:towards me and intoS18:the lava-where itsS18:foot was so burnedS22:that it quickly hoppedS21:away, undignified andS8:annoyed.S17:'Tis my fond hopeS21:that other travellingS21:minstrels shall learnS18:from my experienceS20:and apply themselvesS19:to practicing theseS18:skills in order toS17:preserve life andS5:limb.S14:-Sarah of Yew,S13:Songmistress.S1: S1: S1:

I witnessedS21:them all from my tinyS10:mousehole.S19:Milords British andS14:Blackthron areS20:accustomed to a gameS16:of chess 'pon anS19:evening, over whichS21:they argue the issuesS22:that affect the courseS18:of the realm. LordS21:Blackthorn was on hisS21:way to Lord British'sS17:chambers and LordS18:British stood by aS16:window casement,S20:just having finishedS23:setting the pieces uponS10:the board.S12:Suddenly theS19:shutters blew open,S21:and Lord British fellS18:to the ground, oneS18:hand shileding hisS18:eyes. A chill windS20:entered the room andS19:it seemd a gash wasS21:torn in the very air.S17:Through the gas IS19:could see stars andS18:swirling clouds ofS18:stellar dust and aS19:coldness sucked allS19:the warmth from theS20:air. A terrible windS16:tossed books andS19:blankets across theS18:room and furnitureS8:toppled.S16:From within thisS19:gash issued a greatS19:voice, unlike any IS20:have ever heard. AndS22:these are the words itS12:spoke (for IS19:memorized them mostS12:carefully):,S15:Greetings, LordS22:British. I am the TimeS18:Lord, a being fromS11:beyond yourS22:dimension, as thou artS18:from a world otherS18:than Sosaria. I amS18:here to bring theeS18:warning. Dost thouS19:recall how long agoS19:mysterious StrangerS19:came to Sosaria andS20:saved the world fromS15:the evil wizardS21:Mondain? He shatteredS23:the Gem of Immortality,S22:within which dwelled aS19:perfect likeness ofS11:this world.S19:Lord British slowlyS19:stood and faced theS18:hole in the air. IS18:remember, he said.S17:Oft have I wishedS19:that stranger wouldS7:return.S17:He hath returned,S20:spoke the voice. ButS21:not to here. When theS20:Gem was shattered, aS20:thousand shards wereS20:scattered across theS17:dimensions and inS21:each shard there is aS19:perfect likeness ofS20:this world. And thouS18:dost live upon oneS20:such shard, for thouS19:art not of the trueS14:world-thou artS20:merely a reflection.S19:Lord British lookedS20:shaken by this and IS20:did not know what toS21:think! Was I merely aS18:shadow of the realS21:me, which lives stillS14:somewhere elseS16:across uncountedS11:universes?,S18:My task is to healS21:this shattered world,S22:Lord British, said theS20:voice. And I seek toS17:enlist thee in myS21:cause. Be warned thatS21:in this case, healingS17:carries with it aS15:terrible price.S14:Concern warredS20:with curiosity on myS22:liege's face, but everS17:one to shoulder aS10:burden, heS22:straightened and facedS19:the gash in the airS17:bravely. Name thyS6:price.S12:A shard of aS13:universe is aS18:powerful thing andS21:universe shattered isS16:always in dangerS18:from the powers ofS17:darkness. AlreadyS17:three shards wereS23:turned to evil and sentS22:to plague the originalS20:universe in the formS15:of Shadowlords.S17:Many times have IS20:brought the StrangerS21:back to Britannia, toS20:preserve it from itsS17:own folly or fromS20:outside dangers. YetS20:as long as the worldS23:remaineth in pieces, itS21:remaineth vulnerable.S17:We must bring theS20:shards into harmony,S21:so that they resonateS21:in such a manner thatS20:matches the originalS18:universe. Then theS19:two universes shallS21:merge and be again asS4:one.S18:But if we are onlyS15:shadows... LordS12:British saidS12:wonderingly.S18:The light from theS21:stars within the holeS14:seemed to dim.S11:Indeed, theS17:reflections shallS19:become one with theS21:orginal. Thou wouldstS23:cease to be as thou artS22:and become part of theS22:larger you. Thou shaltS17:not die; however,S21:uncounted generationsS21:have passed and borneS19:children since thatS20:day and they have noS18:counterparts. TheyS21:would perish utterly.S22:Lord British sagged inS20:shock, realizing theS19:terrible price thatS21:would be paid to healS20:the universe. All ofS13:my people, heS9:breathed.S11:Tis for theS14:greateer good.S18:Lord British bowedS9:his head.S16:'Twas then I sawS19:the movement by theS21:door, half-hid by theS19:heavy red curtains.S21:Lord Blackthron stoodS21:there, concealed fromS21:the rest of the room,S19:his face white. HowS16:long had he beenS19:listening? I cannotS23:say, yet I suspect thatS21:he had heard all thatS20:the mysterious voiceS11:had to say.S17:How then, shall IS14:aid thee? LordS13:British said,S16:weariness in hisS6:voice.S16:Aid the nobilityS16:that resideth inS20:human heart. ProtectS19:the Virtues that soS21:recently came to theeS18:in thought late atS19:night. They are theS19:Virtues of life, asS16:your counterpartS19:understands them toS16:be. For when thyS22:populace doth live andS21:breathe these VirtuesS23:shall it match the trueS17:Britannia and thyS18:shard shall rejoinS8:with it.S19:The gash in the airS18:began to close andS20:with it warmth stoleS19:back into the room.S14:I was going toS20:discuss my idea withS19:Blackthorn tonight,S22:Lord British breathed.S18:Have I no thoughtsS19:that are my own?

In theS16:former, phonemesS19:combine into largerS15:words which mayS20:contain full phrasalS20:significance. In theS17:second, prefixingS17:specific phoneticS18:sounds changes theS14:subject of theS21:sentence into object,S14:interrogative,S21:addressed individual,S10:or dinner.S20:Agglutination occursS20:whenever four of theS15:same letter areS21:present in a word, inS19:which case, any twoS14:of them may beS19:removed or slurred.S17:Pitch changes theS16:phoneme value ofS21:individual syllables,S15:thus completelyS20:altering what a wordS13:may mean. TheS18:classic example ifS13:AktgluthugrotS11:bigglogubuuS12:dargilgaglugS19:lublublub which canS19:mean You are such aS15:pretty girl, MyS15:mother ate yourS13:primroses, orS21:Jellyfish nose paintsS22:alms potato, dependingS9:on pitch.S19:Orcish poetry oftenS21:relies upon repeatingS18:the same phrase inS22:multiple pitches, evenS14:changing pitchS16:midword. None ofS17:this great are isS13:translatable.S19:The orcish languageS18:uses the followingS24:vowels: ab, ad, ag, akt,S22:at, augh, auh, azh, e,S20:i, o, oo, u, uu.
