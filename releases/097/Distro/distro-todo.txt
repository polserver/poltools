This is the current TODO list for the distro. Right now this file is new and I'm (tekproxy) the only one who's updated it, and I mostly stuck to magery so I'm not the best person to write this. :) If anyone else feels like editing the crap out of this file, you just think you can do better, or you want to add something, please do!


Monkey work:
 - NPC definitions
    Should we go with OSI NPC definitions? I intend to write a quick database app so my friends
    can input NPC info from stratics and from there I could dump most of the NPC info into npcdesc.cfg files

 - Item definitions
    This would take a little more time to organize once input into a database.

 - World item placement (doors, signs)
    I know one exists and it's probably just a copy/paste job

 - Spawning
    Does anyone know the OSI spawn locations well? I may know someone who can help with this.


Systems:
 - Guilds
    MontuZ estimates 3/4 completed

 - Crafting
    MuadDib is busy making huge piles of money at work

 - Spawning
    Austin said "almost complete"


Skills:
 - magery
    add summons, tweak skill gains, some documentation

 - cooking - unassigned

 - detect hidden - unassigned

 - fishing - unassigned

 - forensic evaluation - unassigned

 - herding - unassigned

 - inscription - unassigned

 - item identification - unassigned

    I was thinking this could be a script that runs on a player and would work like OSI works by improving mana regeneration rates

 - musicianship - unassigned

 - poisoning - unassigned

 - remove trap - unassigned

 - tailoring - Someone is contributing this

    Are we doing control slots?

 - taste identification - unassigned

 - veterinary - unassigned

 - other skills ?




Stat advancement for skills is disabled, but looks mostly complete

BrainAI script for merchants, how far along is this?
  - What about skill training?

pkg/items/clothing/config/itemdesc.cfg needs VendorBuy/Sell values, possibly others

Corpses don't decay. Maybe in corpseControl.src:
	if ( corpse.NPCTemplate() ) // should be !corpse.NPCTemplate()?
		return 0;
	endif

Lockpicking and magic unlock both require locks to have different difficulties. This could easily be done with a CProp on every lockable item, something like LockLevel, and it could be an integer from 1 to 100. Does anyone else have a better idea?


Does anyone else think skill gain is either too easy or too hard? I'm having difficulty with scenarios where I'd want a skill to raise once every few hundred tries, and after about 30 skill only gain in 0.1 increments (instead of the occasional 0.3, 0.2).


In advanceCheck.inc it makes two checks to see if skill gain should happen. The first is made with a pass_chance, which is calculated in skillCheck.inc. If There was more control over what pass_chance would be, possibly making it an optional paramater for SkillCheck()... The second check is made using an intelligence bonus and a task modifier. I think the bonus should depend on the skill. Swords would be strength, magery int, etc... This is what the OSI website says. I really don't want to ruff up Austin's code since he knows his way around it better. Maybe I am missing something? Maybe if each skill had a difficulty that somehow modified skill checks. That way it'd be easier to configure for new people.
