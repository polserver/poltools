# Turn = TurnBoat(boat, #)
# Move = MoveBoatRelative(boat, direction)

# Anchor - 1 = Up 2 = Down
# If the anchor is down, the tillerman will not obey any commands until it is raised.
#
# Stop - 1 = Stops the boat from the last command.
#
# Speed - x.x Multiplied by boats 'normal' speed. ( default_speed * speed )
# Full ahead could be .5, slow could be 2.0 
# The lower the number, the faster the boat will go.
