//Setup of each millable item is:
//milling #				- must go in numerical order, with no gaps
//{
//	mill_item				- should match the number above
//	product_objtype		- objtype of the item produced
//	product_name			- name of the item produced
//	product_amount			- number of the product made in 1 batch
//	ground_item			- objtype of the item that should be ground
//	ground_amount			- number of the item getting ground used in 1 batch
//}
//
//One thing to note about this script is that, at the current time, it is assumed that both
//the item that gets ground and the product are stackable.  If either is not stackable, you
//should not use or produce more than 1 in a batch.
