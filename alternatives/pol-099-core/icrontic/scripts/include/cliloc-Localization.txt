<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Welcome to the Ultima Online Tutorial! This and the following windows will explain how to play Ultima Online. You can use the scrollbar on the right to scroll this text up and down. Press the <B>NEXT</B> button when you are ready to begin!</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 3
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we will learn how to talk in the world of Britannia. First, type the word <B>Hello</B>. See how it appears at the bottom of your screen? This is where you will see the text you type while in the game. When you press enter, it will appear to the players around you. Now press the <B> Enter </B> key. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 4
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>When you pressed the <b> Enter </b> key, the text you had typed appeared above your head. This lets other people know you are speaking. Also, when you see text above the head of someone else you will know they are speaking. Now we will learn how to walk and move around in the world. Move the cursor around your character. See how it changes? This will show you the direction you are going to move in. Clicking the right mouse button will make your character walk. Move the cursor near your character and single click the right mouse button. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 5
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Great Job! You now know how to walk! Now follow the blue footprints on the ground by clicking and holding down the right mouse button. This will make your character continually walk instead of taking one step at a time. Continue following the footprints down the hall to a set of blue magical runes. Walk onto them when you arrive. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 6
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Perfect! Now we will learn how to <B>Pathfind</B>. Pathfinding is an automated walk which will make your character walk around any obstacles in their way. This is activated when you quickly click the right mouse button twice. Move the mouse cursor over the <B> Red </B> runes on the other side of the walls, and double-click the right mouse button.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 7
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Did you notice how your character walked around the obstacles? This is called <B>Pathfinding</B>. Double-clicking the right mouse button will activate Pathfinding when you want it. While your character is moving, it will say Pathfinding above your head. Follow the red footprints down this hallway. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 8
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we will learn how to <B>Run</B>. To Run, click and hold down the right mouse button and move the cursor closer to the edge of the screen. This will make your character Run in that direction instead of walking. Run down this hallway and follow the Blue footprints. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>You're doing great! Now continue following the blue footprints. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 12
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we will learn how to <B>Use</B> objects. To Use an object place your cursor on it and double click the left mouse button. Doing this will allow you to open doors, open chests, and use things like spinning wheels and tools. Double left clicking on some food will let you eat it if you're hungry. Try to open the doors in front of you. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 13
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Perfect! Did you notice how the doors opened when you <B>used</B> them? Now you can walk into the next room. Please go through the open door. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 14
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we will learn more about your character, or avatar. An avatar is your in-game representation. It is how other people can interact with you. By <B>using</B> your avatar you can open your <B>Paperdoll</B>. The paperdoll allows you to see your current status, access important information and abilities, and customize your character. Double Left Click your cursor on yourself to open your paperdoll. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 15
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>This is your paperdoll. It shows you what clothing you are currently wearing and what items you have equipped. The buttons on the right of your paperdoll are very important as they allow you to access game features. The topmost button, <B>Help</B>, will request assistance from one of our in game staff, or direct you to online information. The Help button will also help guide you to the best place to receive answers about Ultima Online. You'll be able to choose an option that best describes your situation. Press the Next button to continue.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 16
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we'll look at the <B>Options</B> button. This will allow you to change your in-game settings, such as screen resolution and text color. The <B>Logout</B> button will permit you to leave the world of Ultima Online. Below that is the <B>Skills</B> button. This will show you a more detailed listing of your character's abilities. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 17
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The <B>Journal</B> button will open up a log of recent speech and actions said and seen by you. The <B>Chat</B> button will take you to an in-game chat room to talk with other players. The <B>Peace</B> button will allow you to go into combat mode to attack monsters. We'll learn how to use that shortly. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 18
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>At the bottom, the <B>Status</B> button will give you information about your Avatar's attributes and statistics. Before we cover those, let's learn about the <B>Backpack</B>. Your backpack is in the lower right corner of your paperdoll. It is where all of your items are stored when you are not wearing or using them. It can be opened by using it. Open it now by double left clicking the cursor on it. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 19
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Wonderful! This is your backpack. It is where you can put the items that you find and need during your adventures through Britannia. Right now, there is a banana inside your backpack. We're going to use it to learn a few more ways you can interact with items. To <B>Look</B> at an item in the world, single left click on it with the cursor. A description will appear above the item when you do this. Look at the banana by moving the cursor over the banana and clicking the left mouse button once. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 20
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>See how the description appears above the object? You can look at any object in the world with a single left click. Let's learn how to pick up things. Picking up an object is done by single, left clicking on it, just as you did to look at it, and then holding the mouse button down. You can then drag the item around. The item will stick to the end of the mouse cursor while you are holding it. Pick up the banana by moving the mouse cursor over it, and left clicking and holding the left mouse button down. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 21
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>GREAT! You have now picked up the banana. Move the mouse cursor around. See how the banana moves accordingly and follows it? This is how you <B>Move</B> objects around in Britannia. Move the mouse cursor back over the backpack and release the left button. This will drop the banana back inside your backpack. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 22
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>You appear to have missed your backpack! The banana has been returned to your backpack for you. Clicking on, holding and dragging is how things can be moved around in the world. Objects in your backpack can be <B>Used</B> just like objects in the world can be used. For example, double left clicking on the banana will let you <B>Eat</B> it. Eat the banana now. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 23
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now you know how to <B>Move</B> an object in the world. Objects in your backpack can be <B>Used</B> just like objects in the world. For example, moving the cursor over the banana and double-clicking the left mouse button will let you <B>Eat</B> it. Eat the banana now. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 24
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>YUM! You ate the banana. There is now a blue Hat in your backpack. Clothing and other equipment can be worn and removed. This is done by picking up and dragging the equipment over to your paperdoll. First, pick up the hat. Again, you do this by moving the cursor over it, and clicking and holding down the left mouse button on it. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 25
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>You are now holding the hat. Be careful! You don't want to release the mouse button, as that would drop it. Drag the hat over to your head in the paperdoll and release the button. Doing this will <B>Equip</B> the hat. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 26
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Oops! You appear to have dropped the hat! I have returned it to your backpack. Try to pick up the hat again. Do this by moving the cursor over it, and left clicking and holding down the button. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 27
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>GREAT! You have <B>Equipped</B> the hat. See how it appears on your avatar as well as your paperdoll? You can equip clothing, weapons and armor in the same way as the hat. Now, let's learn how to take it off. Move the mouse cursor over the hat on your paperdoll, and left click and hold down the mouse button to pick it up. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 28
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now you are holding the hat again. Drag the hat over the backpack and release the left mouse button to drop it in. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 29
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Oops! You appear to have missed the backpack! The hat has been returned to your backpack. Now that you know how to use and manipulate items in the world we are going to learn a little bit about moving the in-game windows around. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 30
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Wonderful! Now that you know how to use and manipulate items in the world we are going to learn a little bit about moving the in-game windows around. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 31
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>First, look in the lower right corner of your paperdoll. Do you see the <B>Dash symbol (-)</B>? This is the <B>Minimize</B> button. It appears on almost all of the windows in Ultima Online. Single left clicking on it will shrink down the window for convenience. Left click on the paperdoll minimize button, or dash symbol. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 32
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>See how the paperdoll has shrunk down to a button-looking window that says <B>Character</B>? This is the minimized version of the paperdoll window. It can be moved around by left clicking and dragging just like any other window. To restore the paperdoll, you just double left click on the Character window. Double left click on it now.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 33
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we'll learn how to <B>Close</B> a window. To close any window, simply single right click on it. Single right click on your paperdoll window. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 34
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>To reopen your paperdoll, simply double left click on your avatar. Now you know how to move, minimize, restore, and close all of the windows available to you. Press the Next button to continue.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 35
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now you'll have a chance to use a little of what you have just learned. Inside of this room is a Red <B>Moongate</B>. A Moongate is a magical portal, which will teleport you elsewhere. The moongate is inside the smaller room with 8 doors. Walk over to these doors, and <B>Use</B> them. (Hint: Double left click on the doors!). After you have opened the doors, walk into the moongate. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 36
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we're going to learn more about your avatar. Move the mouse cursor over your avatar. Now single click the left mouse button, hold it down, and drag the cursor off of your character. Press the Next button when you have done this. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 37
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>This is your <B>Status Bar</B>. It is a handy representation of your avatar's characteristics. There are 3 major characteristics shown here. The first, and most important is the topmost bar. This represents your avatar's <B>Health</B>. Health shows you how hurt your character is. Your Health decreases when you are wounded. As your Health drops lower, the blue bar will shrink. Let's see what this looks like. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 38
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Your Health has been lowered to half. See how the bar is now half blue and half red? The blue portion of the bar shows you how close you are to your maximum in that characteristic. So if you have very little blue left, watch out! Your other characteristics will work the same way. Health regenerates naturally over time. Press the Next button to continue and restore your Health to full. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 39
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The next characteristic, shown as the middle bar, is <B>Mana</B>. Mana shows you how much magical energy that your character has available. Casting a spell will decrease your available Mana. Mana regenerates naturally over time. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 40
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The last characteristic is the bottom bar. This bar measures your current <B>Stamina</B>. The stamina bar lets you know how tired you are. Running, fighting, and other physical activities will decrease your stamina. Be careful not to let your stamina reach 0, as you will become too tired to move! Stamina, just like Health and Mana, regenerates over time. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 41
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we're going to take a closer look at your status. The Status Bar can be maximized to a more detailed Status window by double left clicking on the bar. Maximize the bar now. Press the Next button when you have done this. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 42
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>As you can see this window gives you much more detail about your character. It gives you the number value of your current and maximum Health, Mana, and Stamina, as well as several other statistics. The first statistic, <B>STR</B> is your <B>Strength</B>. This is a measure of how strong and durable your avatar is. The higher your strength is, the more Health you have, and the more you excel at physical activity. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 43
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The next statistic is <B>DEX</B> which stands for your <B>Dexterity</B>. This represents how agile and quick you are. If your Dexterity is very high, you will be able to dodge attacks, and perform physical activities more quickly. Dexterity also affects the amount of Stamina you have. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 44
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The last Statistic is <B>INT</B> which is for your <B>Intelligence</B>. This represents how smart you are. A character with a high Intelligence will excel at mental activities such as spell casting. Intelligence also determines the amount of Mana that you have available. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 45
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Next, <B>SEX</B> shows whether your character is Male or Female. Below that is <B>AR</B> or Armor Rating. AR represents how well protected your character is. The higher the AR, the better protected from damage you are. Press the Next button to continue.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

Index: 46
<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Next are the number values of Health, Stamina and Mana. Below that is <B>Gold</B>. This tells you how much money you currently have. Below that is <B>Weight</B>. Weight is an indicator of how much you are carrying. The more weight you are carrying, the more stamina you will lose during normal physical activity. Excessive weight will prevent you from moving at all! Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

To use Detect Hidden, simply use the skill from the skill list, and target the area or object you wish to search. When you successfully detect a trap, you will "notice something funny" about the object or area, and it will be revealed to all.

Index: 68
As your skill in Detecting Hidden items increases, you may even begin to see traps automatically. This is a very difficult skill to learn, and may start happening after you have passed a skill level of 80 in this skill. Your ability to detect traps in this manner is dependent on the trap level and difficulty, and should not be relied upon in all situations.

Index: 69
Another useful application for this skill involves the homeowner. If you are the homeowner, or friend to a house, and use the detect hidden skill in your household, you will reveal any players that may be hidden there.

Index: 70
Evaluate Intelligence

Index: 71
Evaluating intelligence allows you to learn certain things about the mental makeup of the beings you select.

A high evaluate intelligence skill also allows mages to successfully overcome the natural resistance of creatures to magic.  Therefore, a high evaluate intelligence skill may make a huge difference to a mage.

Index: 72
In order to use evaluate intelligence, you will need to click on the skill from within your skill menu.  This will bring up a targeting cursor.  Select the person or monster on which you would like to use your evaluate intelligence skill.

Index: 76
Fishing

Index: 77
Use of the fishing skill will allow you to catch fish from large bodies of water. Double-click on a fishing pole, then click on a body of water. If successful, you will catch a fish.

Index: 79
Use of this skill will allow you to find information about a corpse, and the events surrounding its demise. Use this skill by clicking the jewel in your skill list.

The higher your skill level, the higher your chances of determining these events, and the accuracy of your description.

Index: 80
This skill is also useful for other reasons. By using this skill on a living person, you may be able to determine their membership in the Thieves guild. Your ability to determine this is based on their skill level as a thief.

Index: 81
You can also use your detective skills to determine who recently picked the locks on locked containers and determine members of the Thieves Guild. Simply use the Forensic Evaluation skill, and target the item you wish to examine. You must be a skilled detective to begin this practice, as you will not be able to begin learning this skill until you have a skill level of 40.

Index: 82
Healing

Index: 83
Use of the healing skill will allow you to heal yourself or other players. To use the skill, simply double click a bandage, and target yourself or the person you wish to heal. If you are successful in your efforts, the recipient will regain health, and the bandage will be used up. To create bandages, simply use scissors on cloth.

Index: 84
If you are healing another player, you must be near them during your efforts, if you leave their vicinity, your efforts will be in vain. If you are disturbed during your work, your fingers can easily slip, and your efforts will have less or no effect.

Index: 85
A highly skilled healer may be able to cure poisons or even resurrect other players. To accomplish this, you must be skilled in both healing, and anatomy. To cure poison, you must have a minimum of 60 skill in each area, and above 80 skill in each area, you may be able to resurrect ghosts.

Index: 86
Herding

Index: 87
Use of this skill will allow you to herd animals. To use this skill you must have a shepherd's crook. Double click the crook, and you will be given a targeting cursor. Simply target the animal you wish to herd, and then click the location you wish the animal to move to. The higher your skill, the more likely you are to successfully herd the animal.

Index: 88
Hiding

Index: 89
The hiding skill allows you to become invisible to other players. To use this skill, simply click the gem next to it in the skill list. If successful, you will become invisible to other players and monsters. You will be revealed if you move, speak, cast a spell, loot a body, attack someone or something, and other possible ways. It can be very difficult or impossible to hide while you are being attacked, so make sure to run a good distance away from your enemy and exit combat mode before attempting to hide. While you are hidden, you are not totally impervious to detection or attack. You can be revealed by spellcasters, the Detect Hidden skill, and can be tracked using the tracking skill. You can also take damage from area effect spells, and purple potions. You must remain wary even while hidden.

Index: 90
Inscription

Index: 91
This skill is used primarily to transcribe spells onto blank scrolls. To inscribe a spell onto a scroll, you must know the spell, have enough mana, and have the appropriate reagents for that spell in your pack (reagents will be consumed in the attempt). To begin, select the inscription skill from your skill list, then select a blank scroll. A scrolling list will appear which displays all of the spells you are capable of casting. From this list, select the spell you wish to inscribe.

Index: 92
To copy a spell from a scroll onto a spellbook, drag the scroll onto the book. Inscription is not necessary to do this.

Index: 93
To cast a spell from a scroll you can simply double click the scroll, and the spell will be cast. There are intelligence and magery requirements for casting spells from scrolls, but they are substantially lower than the requirements to cast them using magery.

Index: 94
Item Identification

Index: 95
Item Identification, if used successfully, will allow you to gather information about the chosen item. To use the skill simply click on the button and then click on the item to be identified. You will be given a description that varies in detail and accuracy depending on your skill level. (Depending on the ability of the user, the evaluation may be off by up to 50%)

Index: 96
Once you have identified an item, you will retain knowledge about that item.  Others will not benefit from your discovery, however.  They will have to identify the item themselves.

Index: 97
Lockpicking

Index: 98
The lockpicking skill is exactly that, it is used to open locked items. In order to attempt to pick a lock, you must have a set of lockpicks in your pack. Lockpicks can be purchased from thief shopkeepers.  Double-click on your lockpicks, and then target the item to be picked. Some locks are harder to pick than others (and some, such as house doors, are impossible to pick). Your skill level will determine your success rate.  If you are successful the lock will be picked, and you can open the item.

Index: 99
This skill is especially useful in hunting treasure from treasure maps. The treasure chests that are found will be locked and often trapped. Use of this skill along with detect hidden (to find any traps) will prove useful.

Index: 100
Lumberjacking

Index: 101
The use of the lumberjacking skill will allow you to gain raw materials in the form of logs. The logs can then be used for carpentry, bowyering, or tinkering. Simply equip a hatchet or an axe, double click the weapon and then click on a tree. If you are successful in recovering wood it will be placed in your pack.

Index: 102
Mace Fighting

Index: 103
Mace fighting is a melee combat skill, which allows for an quick attack style of fighting.  A mace fighter is capable of using a War Axe, Club, Hammer Pick, Mace, Magic Wand, Maul, Smithy Hammer, War Hammer, War Mace, Black Staff, Gnarled Staff, Quarterstaff, and Shepherd's Crook in combat to great effect.

Index: 104
Due to the heavy bashing of a mace weapon, mace fighters have the ability to damage the armor of their opponents and remove their stamina.

Index: 105
Mace fighting, like the other melee combat skills, requires that you have the appropriate weapon equipped.  Once you have the weapon equipped you will need to enter war mode.  You will need to double-click on an opponent to attack them.

Index: 106
Magery

Index: 107
This skill will allow you to cast a variety of spells in the game. The magery skill is automatically checked when you attempt to cast a spell, and your skill level will determine your chances of success in the attempt. To cast a spell, your hands must be free of any items (except a spellbook), you must have a spellbook with the appropriate spell contained therein, and you must have the appropriate reagents in your pack. Simply open the spellbook, choose the spell that you wish to cast, and double click the spell name. You can also click once on the spell name to get a more complete description of the spell, along with a 'tile' that represents the spell. If you wish, you can 'drag' the tile to your play area, and cast the spell by double clicking on the tile. Depending on the spell that you cast, you will be given different options for the next step, but the success or failure of your casting depends on your magery level.

Index: 108
If your spellbook does not contain a spell you wish to use often, simply acquire a scroll for that spell, and drag it into your spellbook. This spell will be added to the spells available for your use from this book.

Index: 109
It is also possible to cast a spell from a scroll. The proper reagents and skill are necessary to prepare the scroll initially, so casting from a scroll requires no reagents, and can be done with a lower level of skill.

Index: 110
Mages benefit greatly from meditation and evaluate intelligence skills.  Meditation improves the rate at which a mage regains lost mana and evaluate intelligence allows a mage to overcome an opponent's resistance to the mage's magic.

Index: 111
Mining

Index: 112
Cultivating the mining skill enables you to harvest the seams of ore that lie in the mines and mountains of Britannia. This ore can then be smelted into ingots (using the mining skill) and the ingots can then be used to craft various items, such as armor (using the blacksmithing skill).

Index: 113
To mine ore you must have either a shovel or a pickaxe in your possession. Double-click on the axe or shovel and then, when the targeting cursor appears, click on a mountainside or a cave wall. If successful, you will mine either a small, medium, or large pile of ore, dependent upon a number of factors. The known ore types, in order of their prevalence, are Iron (the most common), Dull Copper, Shadow Iron, Copper, Bronze, Golden, Agapite, Verite, and Valorite.

Index: 114
The rarity and chances of finding various ores varies directly with the skill level necessary to mine it. The more rare the ore, the higher the skill level necessary to mine it.

Index: 115
A miner who is also a tinker will often be able to be self-sufficient.  Tinkers are able to create shovels and pickaxes necessary for miners.

Index: 116
Musicianship

Index: 117
Use of the musicianship skill will allow you to play an instrument. The ability to play an instrument is necessary for some other skills such as discordance, provocation, and peacemaking. To use this skill, simply double click the instrument of your choice. A music sample will play if you succeed, but an ugly noise will occur if you fail. The higher your skill level, the greater your chances of playing a pretty tune.

Index: 118
Parrying

Index: 119
This skill is used to determine your proficiency at blocking attacks with a shield. If you are using a shield, this skill is checked automatically each time that you are attacked. If successful, your attacker may miss his attack, or do less damage than normal.

Index: 120
Peacemaking

Index: 121
Use of the peacemaking skill will allow you to stop all fights in your immediate area. This skill is related to your musicianship skill, and will automatically check this skill when you use peacemaking. To use the skill, you must click the jewel in your skills list, and then click on your instrument (or the game will remember the last instrument that you played). If you are successful, all fights in the immediate area will stop, at least for a moment. The higher your musicianship and peacemaking skills, the more likely you are to be successful.

Index: 122
Poisoning

Index: 123
The poisoning skill can be used to poison a weapon or even food and drink. This will cause damage to whoever is attacked with the poisoned weapon, or to whoever consumes the food or drink. To poison a weapon simply use the skill from your skill list, and then select the vial of poison you wish to use, and finally click on the item you wish to poison. If you poison a weapon, you will lose karma.  This item will now be poisoned until you use it. Once the poisoned weapon is used you will have to repeat the process to poison it again. The same process is used to poison food or drink. Select the skill and then click on the vial of poison. Then click on the consumable, and presto! The food or drink is now poisoned for a period of time. To create the vial of poison you will need to have the reagent nightshade, and then mix it in pestle and mortar. Once it is mixed, it will pour into the empty bottle in your pack. You can then use this green potion to poison items.

Index: 124
When you wish to poison an item, DO NOT double click the green potion first. If you do this, you will drink the poison. This does not give you the results you had hoped for, as you will have just poisoned yourself.

Index: 125
Provocation

Index: 126
This skill is used to encourage other creatures to fight one other. You will need a musical instrument to accomplish this task. To use the skill, first select the provocation skill from the skills list, target the instrument you wish to use (or the game will remember the one you last used), and then click in turn on each of the creatures you wish to fight one another. If you are successful the two creatures will fight for a time consistent with their respective natures and dispositions. Please keep in mind that you cannot provoke other characters.

Index: 127
Reagents

Index: 128
Black Pearls are rare, and are often referred to as the reagent of movement. When finely ground into a powder, black pearls can invoke spells that teleport of propel the caster to another location.

Index: 129
Blood Moss takes its name from its reddish color. Prevalent in wetter surroundings (such as marshes or swamps), this type of fungi is a base reagent for spells involving locomotion or animation.

Index: 130
The ground paste of a ripe bulb of garlic has a reputation for warding off evil. This effect accurately describes its use as a reagent as well. Modern magicians use garlic in spells that protect the caster (or a specified target) or dispel danger.

Index: 131
Ginseng is hailed as the reagent of health, as its syrup bestows both healing and restoration. Common Britannia folk use it as a home remedy for fatigue and sickness, but true magicians appreciate ginseng for its magical qualities and always keep a healthy portion on hand.

Index: 132
Mandrake Root is harder to find than other reagents, although it is probably the most commonly used of the eight base reagents. Like blood moss, it thrives in dark, dank, areas, where most dare not venture. Those that do search out this precious root are rewarded by being able to cast spells invoking strength and energy.

Index: 133
The nightshade plant is as deadly as its long-standing reputation. Its touch can poison a human; in a magical spell, it invokes powers of death, damage and illusion.

Index: 134
Spider's silk is an inexpensive reagent, as it is quite plentiful and light on one's back, even in large quantities. However, it is so fine that massive amounts of fibers are consumed by a single spell. True to its origin as webbing, this reagent calls forth summoning and binding spells.

Index: 135
Foul smelling but powerful, sulphurous ash is a dusty volcanic residue. It is found mainly in Britannia's mountainous regions and is a common element of any spell releasing fire, light, or explosive energy.

Index: 136
Remove Trap

Index: 137
The skilled rogue will be able to disarm traps using the Remove Trap skill. In order to begin learning the art of removing traps you must first demonstrate proficiency at Lockpicking, and Detect Hidden. You must have a base level of 50 skill in both of those skills before you can begin your training in this area. To use the Remove Trap skill, simply use the skill from the skill list, and target the item that you wish to disarm. If you are successful in your attempt, you will disarm the trap. Failure to disarm the trap stands the possibility of setting off the trap. The higher your skill level, the more difficult the trap you can disarm. You must be very careful when using this skill, it can be quite a risky proposition. To disarm traps, you must be quite nimble, and will find that wearing gloves makes this process much more difficult.

Index: 138
Snooping

Index: 139
The Snooping skill is used to see into another player's backpack. To use the snooping skill, simply double click on another player's pack, and if you are successful, the pack will appear open to you on the screen. Be warned however that a large majority of players do not care for a player who frequents the use of this skill. This skill is best used in conjunction with stealing. To steal from other players, you must be a member of the thief's guild.

Index: 140
Spirit Speak

Index: 141
Spirit Speak is used to be able to understand the speech of ghosts. If you do not have this skill you will only be able to see a series of "oooooo"s emanating from the deceased. To use this skill, simply use the skill from the skill list, and if you are successful you will be able to understand the ghost. Keep in mind that the length of time the interpretation lasts is directly related to the level of skill you have attained and your level of intelligence.

Index: 142
Stealing

Index: 143
The skilled Pickpocket may be able to steal items in several manners, from a variety of sources. You may be able to steal from monsters, chests, NPC's, or other players (if you are a member of the thieves guild, or if they are an opponent in a guild war). You can attempt to steal in two ways. First, use the skill from your skill list, and target the container, creature, NPC, or player. This is a 'random steal' and will attempt to steal an item at random from this source. The second method is to first 'snoop' the container using your snooping skill, and then select a specific object to steal. Dragging this item into your inventory will check your stealing skill to determine your chances of success. The skilled pickpocket must be very dexterous in his or her work, and will find that the more armor you are wearing, the harder it will be to steal.

Index: 144
There are four possible outcomes to stealing:

Index: 145
-  True Success: you get the item and are not noticed

Index: 146
-  Partial Success: you get the item, but are noticed

Index: 147
-  Partial Failure: you do not get the item, but are not noticed

Index: 148
-  Total failure: you do not get the item, and your attempt is noticed

Index: 149
If your attempt is noticed, the guards can be called on you, so you must be very careful when attempting these practices. It is also important to note that for two minutes after stealing, the member of the Thieves' Guild is freely attackable by anyone in the area. In towns, the proscription against starting fights still applies, so even Thieves' Guild members will be safe from random attack, even if everyone knows of their affiliation.

Index: 150
As mentioned above, you will not be able to steal from other players unless you are a member of the thieves guild, or unless the target is an opponent in a guild war. You can join the thieves guild in the usual manner, by finding a Thief Guildmaster and asking him to join. There will be an entrance fee, and there are several entrance requirements. Your character must have adventured in the world for at least one week, must not have any murders to his name, and must have already demonstrated proficiency in stealing (60 skill minimum). The requirements to stay in the guild are stringent as well. If you are reported for murder, you will be summarily ejected from the guild, and cannot rejoin for one week. Also, once you join the guild, you cannot leave for one week, unless ejected from the guild. Thieves Guild members cannot report murders, and thus could be considered "freely" attackable anywhere in the world (except in justice regions, unless they steal from another player).

Index: 151
Swordsmanship

Index: 152
Swordsmanship is a melee combat skill, which allows for a strong-arm attack style of fighting.  A swordsperson is capable of using an axe, a battle axe, a double axe, an executioner's axe, a hatchet, a large battle axe, a pickaxe, a two-handed axe, a butcher knife, a cleaver, a skinning knife, a bardiche, a halberd, a broad sword, a cutlass, a katana, a longsword, a scimitar, or a viking sword in combat to slice there opponents to ribbons.

Index: 153
Only the one-handed weapons of a swordsman can be poisoned.  You must be careful when using a poison weapon, as the poison will damage the weapon and make it more likely to break.

Index: 154
Swordsmanship, like the other melee combat skills, requires that you have the appropriate weapon equipped.  Once you have the appropriate weapon equipped, you will need to enter war mode.  You will need to double-click on an opponent to attack them.

Index: 155
Tailoring

Index: 156
Use of the tailoring skill will allow you to make a wide variety of items, ranging from bandages to clothing, and even leather armor. Your raw materials can come from a variety of sources, from hunting animals for leather, to gathering cotton and spinning thread. You can also purchase materials from a vendor and craft them into items for resale.

Index: 157
To get leather from a cow, you will need to kill it and skin it.  In order to skin the cow, use a bladed weapon on the carcass.  This will leave hides on the corpse.  You may also get hides from other animals.

Index: 158
You may purchase cloth, or you may also find cotton lying in fields.  If you do find cotton, you may use the cotton.  This will bring up a targeting cursor.  Select a spinning wheel to use the cotton on and it will produce cloth.

Index: 159
Once you have your raw materials, you can make a wide variety of items. You need a sewing kit to tailor these items. A sewing kit can be purchased from a tailor.  Use the sewing kit with the materials in your pack. You will be given a window presenting the categories and items that you can craft with your skill level and materials. Choose the item you wish to make, and target the material if necessary. If you are successful, the item will be placed in your pack. If you do not have room in your pack, you will be unable to create the item. As your skill level rises, you will be able to make more complex items, and your chances for success will increase. After creating some items, you may wish to dye them to increase their appeal. You can do this by purchasing a dye tub, and some dyes. Just double click the dyes and select the tub you wish to use them on, then select the color you wish the tub to be. You can then dye items by double clicking the tub, and targeting the item you wish to dye.

Index: 160
Taste ID

Index: 161
Use of Taste Identification will allow you to determine the sort of potion you have in your possession, or to determine if an object is poisoned or not. Simply use the skill from the jewel on your skill list, and then target the item you wish to taste. If successful, you will be told what kind of potion it is (if the object is a potion) or whether or not it's poisoned (if it's not a potion).

Index: 162
Tinkering

Index: 163
The tinkering skill is used to make tools for other professions, and also to make clocks, sextants, and to trap containers. With this skill you can make hammers, tongs, scissors, smoothing planes, and numerous other tools. To make these tools and assorted items you will need a set of tinker's tools. First double-click on the tinker's tools, and then select your supply of metal or wood. A window will open displaying the items that you can make from the raw materials available (either wood or metal). You will need ingots for metal and boards for wood.  Some additional items may be necessary, such as gems for rings.

Index: 164
To place a trap on a container you must have a chest or other container, a poison potion, explosive potion, or crossbow bolt, and a small supply of metal. Use your tinker tools, then target your metal, and choose the type of trap you wish to make. Last, target the container you wish to trap. If successful, the container will become trapped, and the trap you have created will affect the next person who illegally opens this item. Using the proper key on this container will bypass the trap and allow you to open the chest safely. The strength of your trap will be directly related to your skill as a tinker.

Index: 165
Tracking

Index: 166
The tracking skill will allow you to track animals, monsters, and people. Use the skill by clicking the jewel on your skill list. You will be presented with a window, which will allow you to choose what you wish to track. Double-click the category you wish to track (animal, human, or monster), and you will be presented with a second window listing the specific PCs or NPC's that you can track. If you are successful, and an appropriate creature can be tracked, you will be told in what direction that creature can be found. The higher your skill level in tracking, the more likely you are to successfully track an object, and the farther you will be able to track it.

Index: 167
Veterinary

Index: 168
The veterinary skill will allow you to heal animals in much the same way that the healing skill works on people. To use the skill, simply double-click on a bandage, you will receive a targeting cursor, and then target the animal you wish to heal. The amount of healing that you provide will be based on your skill level.

Index: 169
Wrestling

Index: 170
This skill is used while in hand-to-hand combat (no weapon equipped). It is checked automatically when you fight, and may determine the frequency, and damage level with which you will strike your opponent. 

Index: 171
The wrestling skill has several uses in combat and may even be used to stun opponents.  If you do not have a weapon equipped and you attack a creature, your wrestling skill will come into play.

Many people in town can improve your skills. To find out if I can improve skills you are interested in simply walk up to me and say 'TRAIN'. I will give you a list of the skills that I'm proficient in. To choose the skill you want to train in, say 'TRAIN' and the name of the skill you'd like to be trained in, and I will tell you the cost. Drag the gold from your backpack and drop it onto me, and your skill will be increased. If you don't have enough for the full payment, you can pay less but your training won't be as complete and you won't gain as much skill as you could if you paid the full amount. The amount of skill that can be raised is dependant on the ability of the teacher, so it is best to seek out Grand Masters when trying to learn the most about a particular skill. Remember that there is an overall limit to the amount of skills that you can learn, so you may not want to try to learn all of the skills in this manner.

Hello. I am a shopkeeper. If you would like to buy or sell any items, then simply find a shopkeeper and say to them 'VENDOR BUY' in order to see the list of items they sell, or 'VENDOR SELL' in order to see if they're interested in buying anything you own. If you do have any items in your pack that a vendor is interested in purchasing, saying 'VENDOR SELL' will cause him to look through your pack and show you a list of the items he's interested in, as well as what he'll pay for each item. If he's not interested in anything you possess, he will let you know that as well. To purchase an item, simply look through the list that appears when you say 'VENDOR BUY' and select any item you can afford. It will appear at the bottom of your list, along with a running total of your current purchases.

The followers of Minax have taken control in the old lands, and intend to hold it for as long as they can. Allying themselves with orcs, headless, gazers, trolls, and other beasts, they seek revenge against Lord British, for slights both real and imagined, though some of the followers wish only to wreak havoc on the unsuspecting populace.

Index: 449
The council of Mages have their roots in the city of Moonglow, where they once convened. They began as a small movement, dedicated to calling forth the Stranger, who saved the lands once before.  A series of war and murders and misbegotten trials by those loyal to Lord British has caused the group to take up the banner of war.

Index: 450
True Britannians are loyal to the throne of Lord British. They refuse to give up their homelands to the vile Minax, and detest the Shadowlords for their evil ways. In addition, the Council of Mages threatens the existence of their ruler, and as such they have armed themselves, and prepare for war with all.

Index: 451
The Shadow Lords are a faction that has sprung up within the ranks of Minax. Comprised mostly of undead and those who would seek to be necromancers, they pose a threat to both the sides of good and evil. Their plans have disrupted the hold Minax has over Felucca, and their ultimate goal is to destroy all life.

Index: 49

Index: 53
Thou canst purchase clothes on the East side of the river, near the Cypress Bridge.

Index: 54

Index: 55
'Tis an expensive place, but the Unicorn Horn, overlooking the ocean on the east side, serves a decent ale.

Index: 56
'Tis being repaired, but it stands on the promontory o'erlooking Brittany Bay.

Index: 57
'Tis the bay on our southern coast.

Index: 58
Try the bowyer just East of the theatre.

Index: 59
Try the stables beside the Mage Tower.

Index: 60
Which sort of smith? Weaponsmith, blacksmith?

Index: 61
Blackthorn's castle is on an island in the middle of a lake North of Britain.

Index: 62
Incantations and Enchantments is in the middle of eastern Britain, on the south side of the park.

Index: 63
There are many bridges across the Brittany. There's the Great Northern Bridge at the north-most end, the Mage's Bridge, then the one we call Virtue's Pass. South of that there's Cypress Bridge, and the River's Gate Bridge. And, of course, the Gung-Farmer's Bridge connects Britain with the farmlands to the West.

Index: 64
The bridge next to the Mage's tower is thus called the Mage's Bridge.

Index: 65
The Cypress Bridge is surrounded on one side by a tailor's shop and on the other by a magic shop.

Index: 66
The Great Northern Bridge is so called because it's the Northern-most bridge in Britain.

Index: 67
The Gung-Farmer's Bridge connects all the farms with Britain proper.

Index: 68
The Southernmost bridge is called River's Gate.

Index: 69
There are three or four merchants of the arcane in Britain.

Index: 70
There's the Salty Dog, The Unicorn's Horn, The Cat's Lair, and The Blue Boar taverns, here in Britain.

Index: 71
Thou art in Britain.

Index: 72
Thou can find the Ethral Goods Magic Shop just south of the Main Gate. Next to the Premier Provisioner's shop.

Index: 73
Thou can get to the Sage Advice Magic Shop on the east side of the river.

Index: 74
Thou can purchase arcane goods at the Sorcerer's Delight - which some call the Mage Tower. It can be found in northern Britain, next to the Conservatory of Music.

Index: 75
Thou can work on thy swordplay at the old keep, south of Lord British's castle.

Index: 76
Ah, the weather... 'Tis an interesting thing, really. No matter what the season, no matter what enchantments are cast, our land is almost always blessed with clear and beautiful blue skies.

Index: 77
Bedrolls can be purchased from a provisioner.

Index: 78
Britanny Bay is the body of water on the edge of Britannia's capital.

Index: 79
Certainly, thou art welcome.

Index: 80
Cove? Thou shouldst find it North and East of Britain.

Index: 81
Dupre? Ah, yes, Lord British's friend and ally, I believe. If thou wert to search for him, I wouldst most recommend a tavern.

Index: 82
Excellent. 'Tis my lucky day.

Index: 83
Farewell.

Index: 84
Goodbye.

Index: 85
Greetings.

Index: 86
Hello.

Index: 87
Here.  In Town.

Index: 88
I accept.

Index: 89
I am well.

Index: 90
I cannot help thee.

Index: 91
I cannot speak but fondly on my homeland. Yet I would not forgo an opportunity to see other lands.

Index: 92
I can't take it. Sorry.

Index: 93
I don't want it. Sorry.

Index: 94
I have heard that the great dungeons sometimes have great treasures.

Index: 95
I know not of which thou doth speak.

Index: 96
I live here in _Town_.

Index: 97
I live in the town that thou art standing in.

Index: 98
I really don't need it.

Index: 99
I shall accept with pleasure.

Index: 100
I shall be happy to take it!  Thank thee!

Index: 101
I will take it, then.

Index: 102
I work here in town.

Index: 103
I work in the town that thou art in.

Index: 104
I would not live in Buccaneer's Den if I were thee, for it is home to the most vile men and women to sail the seas.

Index: 105
If thou art able to hunt the wild animals, sometimes thou can sell the meat that thou dost carve from them to a butcher.

Index: 106
If thou art wanting a respite from the rigors of Britannia, then thou can make a camp or check in to an Inn, whichever is the most convenient.

Index: 107
If thou can get an axe, perhaps thou could cut some trees into useful boards for woodworkers. They may be willing to pay thee for them.

Index: 108
If thou dost happen upon some ore, go to the blacksmith's shop and try to craft some armor or weapons. I have heard that it just takes practice.

Index: 109
If thou dost want to earn money, practice a skill. Make things and sell them to the public. Most shopkeepers will let thee use the tools and materials that they aren't using.

Index: 110
I'm doing relatively well.

Index: 111
Iolo? Ah, yes, Lord British's friend and ally, I believe.

Index: 112
It's essential to have good kindling and a bedroll if thou dost want to camp.

Index: 113
I've been needing one of these.

Index: 114
I've heard that Lord Blackthorn has written a couple of books describing his philosophies in-depth. If thou dost find these, I imagine thou wouldst be able to say better than I what Blackthorn is about.

Index: 115
Just fine.

Index: 116
Let's see... I remember the names of Shame, Wrong, Despise, and Hythloth. I've never owned a map of Britannia myself.

Index: 117
Lord Blackthorn wishes the freedom of choice in ALL things extended to everyone. Some say that he'd even sees the Orcs and Lizardmen as equals to the humans in Britannia.

Index: 118
Lord Shamino? Ah, yes, Lord British's friend and ally, I believe.

Index: 119
Not a problem.

Index: 120
Only the bravest knights belong to the Order of the Silver Serpent. 'Twas they who defeated the forces of Lord Robere.

Index: 121
Our moons are called Trammel and Felucca. They control the moongates.

Index: 122
Please back away a bit.

Index: 123
Please, keep it. I don't want it.

Index: 124
Right here.

Index: 125
Shrines to the virtues are spread around our land. I've heard that they can even resurrect the dead.

Index: 126
Tanners will buy hides and pelts that thou dost take from the animals thou dost hunt.

Index: 127
Thank thee!

Index: 128
Thank thee, but I don't want it.

Index: 129
Thank thee. Don't need any.

Index: 130
The moongates? They are... doors to different parts of Britannia. Except the destinations of the doors change with the phases of the two moons.

Index: 131
The name is familiar to me... ah, yes -- I believe he is the infrequent guest of Lord British. Mayhaps thou wilt find him sampling the local spirits.

Index: 132
There are many as yet unmapped places beneath Britannia. 'Tis rumored to be riches and magic in them. And creatures that will rend the flesh from thy bones.

Index: 133
This will come in handy indeed.

Index: 134
Thou art most kind!

Index: 135
Thou art most kind, but it isn't anything that I need.

Index: 136
Thou art nearer to me than I like.

Index: 137
Thou can find a good deal of treasure under Britannia. Look to the caves and what thou call dungeons.

Index: 138
Thou can sell feathers from birds to a bowyer. And a cook may purchase the bird itself from thee.

Index: 139
Thou shouldst be able to get kindling from any wood thou finds. If thou has an axe, of course.

Index: 140
Thou shouldst learn to use the moongates if thou dost plan to travel far. The key is in the phases of the moons.

Index: 141
Though a kind and generous man in his youth, Lord Robere thirsted for power in his later years, so legends say.  Had not the Order of the Silver Serpent been ready to fight for Lord British, this very land could have belonged to the ambitious conqueror.

Index: 142
Thou'rt welcome.

Index: 143
Tis the bay that touches the city of Britain.

Index: 144
Tis very generous of thee, but I don't need it.

Index: 145
Tis very generous of thee.

Index: 146
Various issues surface from time to time, such as taxation, invasion, protection form creatures of the wild.

Index: 147
Vesper? 'Tis a city in northeastern Britannia. Ore from the mines of Minoc are sent down river to be unloaded in Vesper.

Index: 148
Well, well, what have we here?

Index: 149
Why standest thou so near to me?

Index: 150
Wilt thou stand back a bit

Index: 151
Aye, we have a tanner. He's in the center o' town.

Index: 152
Britain thou'rt askin' about? I'm told 'tis the biggest city in the land. Don't see what all t'fuss is about. The size of hereabouts is plenty big for me.

Index: 153
Britain? 'Tis the capital of the whole wide world, o'course. Sits on the shore of Britanny Bay way off yonder.

Index: 154
Healing shrines are found all about Britannia.

Index: 155
I know nothing of any avatar.

Index: 156
I may have heard a legend of a city called Wind. It was in the mountains, if I recall.

Index: 157
If thou'rt looking for Trinsic, 'tis south, but along the eastern coast.

Index: 158
I've never seen Lord British myself.

Index: 159
Jhelom? 'Tis to be found at the very most northern tip of the largest Valarian Isles.

Index: 160
Nujel'm is an island city. Part of Britannia, but ... different.

Index: 161
Ocllo ... hmmm. 'Tis an island, I believe.

Index: 162
Our healer sets to the east side, between the two bridges. If thou seest the inn, thou hast gone too far north.

Index: 163
Our inn is up past the northern bridge.

Index: 164
Right beside the woodworker and blacksmith, thou'lt find our bathhouse.

Index: 165
Skara Brae? Thou canst not get more west than that!

Index: 166
The blacksmith is to the northwest, past the bath house.

Index: 167
The provisioner is southmost in town.

Index: 168
The tanner set up shop south of the healer.

Index: 169
The taverns are south, west of the provisioner.

Index: 170
The woodworker is next to the blacksmith.

Index: 171
Thou'rt in Buccaneer's Den.

Index: 172
Trinsic? 'Tis near the Cape of Heroes, I think.

Index: 173
Verity Isle is Moonglow's whereabouts. The island is named so for the city puts much store in lofty intellectual pursuits.

Index: 174
Vesper can be found on the eastern coast of Britannia, to the north.

Index: 175
Yew ... ahh, that is near to Empath Abbey. That's the land from whence the best wine comes.

Index: 176
I know many virtuous people.

Index: 177
If thou'rt in need of medical attention, there is none better to visit than our healer on the southern side of our village.

Index: 178
Our armourer is a fine hand with metal and leather. Feel free to view his wares in his shop two or three doors north of the healer.

Index: 179
Our lighthouse stands proud and straight to the north of the village ... not even a long walk's distance.

Index: 180
The orcs are bolder here than they dare elsewhere. They come from the fort to the south.

Index: 181
The orcs live safe in their fortress to the south, and when they set out, we have no warning.

Index: 182
This is Cove, friend. Not as fancy as a big city town, but a good place, with good people.

Index: 183
We have a small dock. 'Tis on the north side of town, right on the water, o'course.

Index: 184
A bit of action, eh? The Dueling Pit is in the center of town, of course.

Index: 185
Cemetery? We've got one, sadly a necessity, and it's to the far west of town.

Index: 186
Docks? Why, there are no less than four docks in Jhelom. One to the east of the main town, and one to the south, another on our northernmost island, and one on our southernmost isle.

Index: 187
Food can be most easily purveyed from the small shop a bit north and east of the town's southern docks.

Index: 188
If thou art looking for Jhelom's inn, it is north of the main southern docks.

Index: 189
I'll not ask thy business at the Thieves' Guild. 'Tis just south of the Dueling Pit, beneath the Library.

Index: 190
I'm told our weapons shop is one of the best. It is west and south from the Dueling Pit.

Index: 191
In my opinion, we have a fine woodworker. I'd call his shop south-central, though 'tis a bit to the east.

Index: 192
Indeed, the Fighters' Guild is in Jhelom. In fact, there are two. One is at the northern edge of the town, just west of the blacksmith. One is the farthest building south.

Index: 193
Jhelom is any mercenary's second home. 'Tis no finer place for selling thy sword arm. While it's still attached, at least.

Index: 194
Last I saw, there was a mage's shop just north of the theater. That's on the southern isle, thou knowest.

Index: 195
Library? We've got one, friend, and it's just south of the Dueling Pit.

Index: 196
Lord British? Why, he's our ruler, of course!

Index: 197
Our tinker is north and east of the main isle's southern gate.

Index: 198
Ranches are on the north-most island.

Index: 199
Sure, every fighter is interested in armor. My favorite is the nearest building to the eastern gate. There's another, too, at the south end of town.

Index: 200
The baker is north of the Weapons shop, west of the Dueling Pit.

Index: 201
The best place to buy fish is found just east of the Dueling Pit.

Index: 202
The clothes shop is to the southwest of town, betwixt the jeweler and the Thieves' Guild.

Index: 203
The Fisher's Guild is the most southern thing in the town, friend.

Index: 204
The guard tower is south of the Dueling Pit, on the far side of the library.

Index: 205
The Healer? Why close on to the Dueling Pit, of course!

Index: 206
The shipwright is nearest the town's eastern docks, but south of the armourer.

Index: 207
The tailor? That shop is on the southern island. It's a small island, but still Jhelom, right enough.

Index: 208
The Theater is on the southern isle.

Index: 209
Thou canst find him to the west of town, past the clothier and the Thieves' Guild.

Index: 210
Thou wilt find a provisioner on the eastern side of the main town, midway between northmost and southmost.

Index: 211
Town Hall? Find the Dueling Pits, near the center of town, then head a few paces north and east.

Index: 212
Town tavern? 'Tis a grand place for ale and perhaps a brawl or two. I recommend it. Head east from the Dueling Pit, and when thou smellest fish, turn right.

Index: 213
We do have blacksmith shops, one north of the city, just west of Town Hall, and another to the south, near the southern docks.

Index: 214
We have two. One south of town, and one on the southern isle.

Index: 215
A fine tavern is located in the southeast section of the city, near the bakery.

Index: 216
A small island southeast of the main city, is where the council meets in the House of Parliament.

Index: 217
Above the magic shop located in the southern part of the city, the mage's guild has a lovely meeting hall.

Index: 218
Artists are rare in Magincia. We import most of our artwork. 'Tis too much work and effort to create it ourselves.

Index: 219
Magic doth provide a variety of conveniences. But 'tis more a variant of technology than the manipulation of ether, that keeps our houses clean without having to work at it.

Index: 220
Many a great speech hath been heard in the town square in the north of the city, beside the temple.

Index: 221
New Magincia? 'Tis nothing wrong with this fine city ... we do not need a new one.

Index: 222
Parliament doth consist of a nine member council. The retiring council member hath the responsibility of appointing their replacement.

Index: 223
The bakery is located on the southeastern tip of the main island before you cross the bridge to Parliament.

Index: 224
The best tailor is located next to the shipwrights on the far southwest side of the city.

Index: 225
The docks are located on the far south side of the city.

Index: 226
The fish market is located on the city's docks, on the south side.

Index: 227
The healer's hall is on the westernmost street in the city, toward the southern end, near the tailor's and the fish market.

Index: 228
The jeweler's shop is located on the far west side of the city, between the Miner's Guild Hall and the tailor's shop.

Index: 229
The local inn is located nearly in the exact centre of the city. A small park lies to the north of it.

Index: 230
The merchants meet in the building behind the fish market. 'Tis near the docks on the south side of the city.

Index: 231
The miner's guild is located on the western edge of town, behind the inn.

Index: 232
The people of Magincia are direct descendants of those who forged the world, and one day we will inherit the world, and make our way to the stars and take our place as the rulers of all the lands below. We have good cause to be proud.

Index: 233
The pirates of Buccaneer's Den resent our wealth, but hath begun to raid less and less often thanks to magical items of protection purchased from Moonglow.

Index: 234
The provisioner shares space with the fish market. 'Tis located on the city docks on the far south end of the city.

Index: 235
The shipwrights, why 'tis located on the south side of the city on the docks.

Index: 236
The temple is located near the beach to the far north, just east of the town square.

Index: 237
The tinker's shop is located just south of the steps leading toward the town square on the north end of town.

Index: 238
There's a warehouse that stocks all kinds of goods on the east side of the city near the tinker's shop.

Index: 239
Thou canst purchase magical goods in the southern end of the city along the central street.

Index: 240
Both Miners' Guild halls are near the center of town.

Index: 241
Dancing is a sport in Minoc. Sometimes the music is louder than the blacksmith's anvil next door.

Index: 242
I do not know of a place called 'Buccaneer's Den'.

Index: 243
Miners' tents are east and south of town. They stay close to the mines, mostly.

Index: 244
Minoc is about thee. There is not much north of here, friend.

Index: 245
Minoc is not so large a city that we must separate the homes from the businesses. Houses are throughout the town.

Index: 246
Our healer's shop is in the southeastern corner of town.

Index: 247
Soldiers and professional fighters all gather in their hall, which is near center of town, one door south of the tavern.

Index: 248
Supplies are a steady business in Minoc. We have a provisioner on both the north and south sides of town.

Index: 249
The butcher's shop is at the very northwest corner of Minoc.

Index: 250
The horses are kept a bit apart from the town. The stable is north, just northeast of the tavern.

Index: 251
The mines are due east of town.

Index: 252
The tavern is in the north part of town, near to the butcher and warriors' guild.

Index: 253
The woodworker has a good selection of material in these parts. The shop is on the east side of town, just a bit of wander north of the tanner.

Index: 254
Thou'lt find our tinker in the center of Minoc.

Index: 255
Thou'rt lookin' for the blacksmith? The smithy is on the far side of town from the stables.

Index: 256
We have but one tanner, and thou'lt find the shop south, but not so far as the provisioner.

Index: 257
We have two guilds: the Warriors' and the Miners'.

Index: 258
We think pretty highly of our armourer. His shop in the southeast corner of town has brisk business.

Index: 259
All manner of baked goods can be found just south of the docks.

Index: 260
Fine armour can be had from the armoury in the center of town. Look to the west of Moonglow, to one side of the street that leads west out of town.

Index: 261
Fresh fruit can be had at a humble store near the center of town. It is just south of the inn, if thou'rt interested.

Index: 262
If it were not for the zoo in southern Moonglow, the mages would have to trek into the wilds to view these humble creatures ... and grass stains make for angry apprentices.

Index: 263
If thou'rt looking for the town hall, look to the southwest corner of the heart of Moonglow.

Index: 264
Indeed, Moonglow has several Mages' Guilds. Three in fact. One to the south, one to the east and one to the north.

Index: 265
Master mages are usually professors at the Lycaeum. They can be found there, or in their homes, or sometimes about the streets of Moonglow. They are usually willing to answer questions.

Index: 266
Moonglow was founded by Lord British to be a research colony. The Lycaeum is where the research takes place. Nearly all new magic in Britain comes from that building on the northwest peninsula.

Index: 267
North of the Gadgeteers' Guild is a mage scholar who will teach travelers his lore, regardless of whether they attend the Lycaeum.

Index: 268
Our healer is in the central part of Moonglow, on the far western side. It is but two doors away from the teleporters, and that's a good thing, I promise.

Index: 269
Our tailor has a central location, just across the street from the provisioner.

Index: 270
Reagents are quite in demand in Moonglow. There is a store devoted to their sale, close by the teleporters.

Index: 271
Teleporters? Well, there's one near the Lycaeum, of course, one by the zoo, one near the eastern residence section, and one near the northern houses.

Index: 272
The artists live near their guildhall. If thou'rt interested in visiting Moonglow's bastion of the finer arts, look to the east of the main town area. The artists are close by where the road turns northward.

Index: 273
The best place in Moonglow to buy supplies would be at the provisioner's shop, just south of the docks.

Index: 274
The butcher is across the street from the herbalist. If thou'rt lost, both meat and herbs are to the west of the central teleporters.

Index: 275
The cemetery is found to the south of the city. It is a small one, but strikingly serene.

Index: 276
The docks are easy enough to get to ... they are north of the city proper, and in betwixt the two 'prongs' that extend north into the sea.

Index: 277
The Gadgeteers' Guild is in the heart of the city, to the southeast of the teleporters.

Index: 278
The herbalist is found but one door south of the shop of reagents. Theirs customers are similar, but their businesses do not conflict as often as thou might suspect.

Index: 279
The inn is east a ways from the docks, a bit south. If thou sees the Artists' Guild, thou art too far east. If thou finds the scholar mage's place, thou art too far south.

Index: 280
There is one apprentice for each Mages' Guild. Therefore, one is to be found near the northern Guild, one near the southern Guild, and one to the east.

Index: 281
Thou canst guess from our city's name that our scholars are intrigued by celestial objects. In the eastern part of the city, near the shore, we have the realms' largest eyeglass pointed at the sky.

Index: 282
Thou should stop and take a look at the woodcarver's wares. Thou'lt find the store just north and a bit west from the main teleporter location. The skill and detail work are, I think, second to none.

Index: 283
We are on Verity Isle. The island is named so for the city puts much store in lofty intellectual pursuits.

Index: 284
We have a mage who deals in potions and other such things. Look a bit south of the tailor, just to the northeast of the teleporters.

Index: 285
And why wouldst thou be needing a cemetery? Sure, thou'rt neither so old, nor so ill? Well, thou'lt find it to the far northwest, outside the city walls.

Index: 286
Aye, The Silver Bow. 'Tis a bit quieter than Mystical Spirits, I'll tell that that. 'Tis further from the casino than Mystical Spirits, just south of the concert hall. Draws a milder crowd.

Index: 287
Dost thou mean the gazebo? The little open-air wooden structure on the southeast side of town? 'Tis between The Silver Bow tavern and Restful Slumber inn.

Index: 288

Find Uzeraan.  Uzeraan will explain what you need to do next.

Index: 40
Uzeraan says:  Hello! I am the grand Conjurer, Uzeraan. I have a few tasks for you to perform.

Index: 41
You have arrived not a moment too soon, stranger.  Terrible things have happened and we need your help!

Index: 42
This island has been plagued with foul creatures ever since the mysterious dark force began its invasion.

Index: 43
I know we have just met, but our need is dire and I must ask of you a favor.

Index: 44
For some time now, our hunters have been disappearing in the forests of this island.

Index: 45
We believe vile 'Shadow Wisps' are responsible for these disappearances.

Index: 46
Go forth and kill at least 6 of these 'Shadow Wisps'. See if you can find any evidence of our missing men.

Index: 47
Well done! You have completed your task of slaying the 'Shadow Wisps'.

Index: 48
Return to Uzeraan and tell him of your findings.  He is no doubt eagerly awaiting your return.

Index: 49
Return to Uzeraan and tell him of your findings.

Index: 50
Uzeraan gives you a somber look and begins to speak slowly:

Index: 51
You bring sad news stranger and I fear our men may be lost forever. They will be mourned.

Index: 52
You, however, have shown great Valor in your battle against the wretched 'Shadow Wisps'. I am pleased.

Index: 53
For your efforts I have placed a small token of my appreciation in your backpack.

Index: 54
Unfortunately, I have more disturbing news. We once had an underground cavern that we used for mining ore.

Index: 55
It seems horrible creatures have been emerging from the caves at night, terrorizing the villagers.

Index: 56
In their folly, a mob of frightened villagers collapsed the entrance to the mining cave.

Index: 57
The villagers did not know that I had recently installed a teleporter in the cave.  It was designed to give the workers a quick way to return home from the cave.

Index: 58
What's worse is that this teleporter only goes one way: Out of the cave, into our village.

Index: 59
The horrid phantasms still haunt us on a nightly basis using MY teleporter to get here. We have no way to get into the cave!

Index: 60
Well - there is one way. Let me tell you something of magic travel...

Index: 61
MAGIC TRAVEL:

Index: 62
To begin with, you need what is called a recall rune.  Blank recall runes can be purchased at most any magic supply shop.

Index: 63
Then, you need either in your spellbook, or inscribed on a scroll a 'Mark' spell. 'Tis a spell of the 6th circle.

Index: 64
You then cast the Mark spell and target the recall rune. This inscribes the rune with the location at which you are standing.

Index: 65
To instantly return to the location where the rune was marked, you employ the 'Recall' spell.

Index: 66
This spell is of the 4th circle and you should have little trouble with it.

Index: 67
Simply cast the Recall spell and target the marked recall rune of the location you wish to travel to.

Index: 68
There is also another, called 'Gate Travel' which operates on the same principles as the Recall spell.

Index: 69
Gate Travel allows you to open a magical gate to the location of your marked recall rune. This way, others can travel with you.

Index: 70
Gate Travel is of the 7th circle however, and you will not be able to weave such intricate magic for a while.

Index: 71
Now - to get back to the subject at hand.  Whilst I was working in the caves, installing the teleporter, I marked a rune.

Index: 72
This would, in theory, allow us to travel into the cave to investigate the condition of our mining resources.

Index: 73
Unfortunately, to cast any spell, one must have the necessary reagents. Reagents that I do not have.

Index: 74
My supply of Mandrake Root has run dry and so I can not cast any of the magic travel spells needed to enter the cave.

Index: 75
I must ask of you to go and gather Mandrake Root for me.  Try the reagent shops if you have money, or find another way if you do not.

Index: 76
I have no money for reagents to give you at this time, but be assured that I will repay you.

Index: 77
Please hurry - time is short and so is our supply of fighters to fend off the wicked creatures.

Index: 78
Uzeraan nods at you with approval and begins to speak:

Index: 79
Thank you stranger. You are not a moment too soon. For your help I have placed a few scrolls in your pack to aid you.

Index: 80
Just a few Mark and Recall scrolls for you to try out. I've also given you some blank recall runes.

Index: 81
Now I can send the few remaining soldiers in to the cave to investigate the state of affairs.

Index: 82
On second thought, *YOU* would do much better against the wretched wraiths than any of our soldiers.

Index: 83
Go and gather any other supplies you think you will need and then return here. I will transport you below upon your return.

Index: 84
I was beginning to think you would not return. I am glad to see that I was mistaken.

Index: 85
Go now into the caves below and find out what you can about the creatures coming from there.

Index: 86
Slay 6 of the creatures and gather any information on their weaknesses that you can.

Index: 87
Remember that there is a teleporter somewhere in the cave that will lead back to the surface.

Index: 88
Mission Complete.  You have slain the restless souls as instructed. Return to Uzeraan to report.

Index: 89
Uzeraan looks very disturbed at your report.  After a long silence he speaks to you:

Index: 90
It seems the caves are lost to us as the restless souls you describe have made it their new home.

Index: 91
The villagers wanted me to thank you for your help and have given me some items to reward you with.

Index: 92
I have placed some reagents, a few scrolls and some gold in your pack.

Index: 93
The issue of the restless souls requires more investigation, but alas, a more pressing matter has surfaced.

Index: 94
My friend and associate, Aegis The Archmage of Moonglow, has been secretly working on a new spell formula.

Index: 95
The new spell would easily swing the tides in our favor in the battle against this unknown evil that has befallen us.

Index: 96
Apparently, many of Aegis' apprentices have been getting abducted in an attempt to force information from them.

Index: 97
I have just received word from Aegis that one of his most trusted students was taken!

Index: 98
We must send someone to find the apprentice and free him before he is slain! Time is limited!

Index: 99
You, dear friend, have proven yourself worthy of such a quest.  I have sent word to Aegis that I will send you to aid him.

Index: 100
Go and gather any supplies you may need for your journey. Return here when you are ready to depart for Moonglow.

Index: 101
Excellent. You have returned.  I will transport you to Moonglow now.

Index: 102
Upon your arrival, follow the path North and you will find Moonglow.

Index: 103
Aegis runs a reagent shop west of the teleporter park within the Moonglow city walls.

Index: 104
If you have any trouble finding it, ask other adventurers around you and I am sure someone will aid you.

Index: 105
Good luck, young mage. I hope you succeed. May the aethers have mercy upon us if you do not.

Index: 106
You have found Aegis!

Index: 107
The Archmage's face lights up as he spots you in the doorway.

Index: 108
Thank the heavens! Uzeraan said he would send someone, but I did not expect you so soon.

Index: 109
As I am sure Uzeraan has told you, one of my apprentices was abducted.

Index: 110
Tis a bad omen, as this was one of the few apprentices who knew of my new spell formulas.

Index: 111
No doubt the mysterious dark force is behind the abduction of my most valuable student.

Index: 112
I must ask you to go after the evil undead that abducted my apprentice and return him to safety.

Index: 113
In their haste to escape, one of the abductors dropped a marked recall rune.

Index: 114
No doubt it leads to the place where they are holding my young wizard captive.

Index: 115
I have the rune right here. No?  Maybe in this pocket? No. Well - this is most embarrassing.

Index: 116
Go and fetch yourself some supplies for the forthcoming battle and I will continue my search for the rune.

Index: 117
Unfortunately, I have not been able to recover the rune yet. Please return in a few minutes. I will keep looking.

Index: 118
My ancestors smile upon me. I have found the rune to the prison camp.  With this rune we can find the lost apprentice.

Index: 119
I will transport you now to the location that was inscribed on this rune. I pray it takes you to my student wizard.

Index: 120
Slay his captors and release him from his bondage. Take these scrolls with you - they will help.

Index: 121
They are scrolls with the 'Unlock' spell inscribed upon them.  This spell can be very useful.

Index: 122
Remember however, that the Unlock spell only unlocks things that were locked using the 'Magic Lock' spell.

Index: 123
Also keep in mind that not only doors can be locked with the lock spell, but also containers of all sorts.

Index: 124
Now go. Time is short!  Return here when you have saved my apprentice.

Index: 125
Quest Complete! You have saved the apprentice.  Return to Aegis and speak with him.

Index: 126
Aegis smiles at you with a look of great satisfaction.

Index: 127
Well done young Mage!!!  Stay on the path of virtue and continue your lessons in the arcane arts.

Index: 128
I foresee that you will become a mighty spell wielder who will gain many honors throughout Britannia.

Index: 129
I thank you for saving my apprentice and therein saving our cause. I feel a reward is in order.

Index: 130
Gold is also always welcome I think, so here is a check for 1000 gold. Don't squander it now, ye hear?

Index: 131
Take this magical wizard's hat. It tends to be rough on the body, but does wonders for the mind.

Index: 132
I hope we meet again in the future my friend. I am indebted to you always.

Index: 133
Find Uzeraan.  Uzeraan will explain what you need to do next.

Index: 134
Go forth and kill at least 6 of these 'Shadow Wisps'. See if you can find any evidence of our missing men.

Index: 135
Return to Uzeraan and tell him of your findings.

Index: 136
Find 75 Mandrake roots and return them to Uzeraan. Try checking the local reagent shops.

Index: 137
Gather supplies for battle and return to Uzeraan when you are ready.

Index: 138
Venture into the mining cave and slay 6 of the restless souls. Use the teleporter in the cave to return.

Index: 139
Find the teleporter in the cave and return to Uzeraan.

Index: 140
Gather any supplies you need and return to Uzeraan when you are ready to leave for Moonglow.

Index: 141
Find Aegis the Archmage in the city of Moonglow. His shop is west of the teleporter park.

Index: 142
Explore the town and gather supplies for battle. Return to Aegis when you are ready.

Index: 143
Check in with Aegis after a while to see if he has recovered the rune to the prison camp.

Index: 144
Find the prison camp where the abducted apprentice is being held. Slay his oppressors and free him.

Index: 145
Return to Aegis and tell him you have freed his apprentice.

Index: 146
Uzeraan lives in his mansion within the city of Haven.  Find him and he will give you instructions on tasks he would like you to do for him.

Index: 147
Uzeraan explains tasks for you to become a better blacksmith.  He has requested that you find an anvil and forge.

Index: 148
Uzeraan says: Hello!  I am the grand Conjurer, Uzeraan.  I have a few tasks I'd like you to perform.

Index: 149
These tasks will help you to become a better blacksmith and make tools to aid your smithing.  The tasks are not pointless, as an army needs the weapons and armor you make.

Index: 150
First, I would like you to find an anvil and forge.  The anvils and forges can be found on this floor of my mansion.

Index: 151
Forge a ringmail tunic with your smithy hammer or tongs.  Uzeraan has more information, once you make the ringmail tunic.

Index: 152
At the forge and anvil, you craft the items of your blacksmithy trade.  To protect yourself, you should craft a ringmail tunic.

Index: 153
To use an anvil and forge, you must be standing next to them.  An anvil and forge allows you to use tongs or a hammer.

Index: 154
The tongs or hammer you use are in your backpack or hand. Double-clicking the tongs or hammer should bring up a menu to allow you to blacksmith.

Index: 155
If you are too far from the anvil and forge, you will not get the menu.  If you do not have enough ingots in your backpack for the item you want to smith, then you will not be able to make it.

Index: 156
Visit Uzeraan once you have made your ringmail tunic.

Index: 157
Uzeraan explains why you need the ringmail tunic for protection.  The mountains south of the mansion have ore to mine, but may have a critter or two that are hostile.

Index: 158
Uzeraan says: Now that you have made a ringmail tunic, you will need more ingots to supply yourself for future armor and weapons you make.  Ingots are made from ore that you mine off of mountains.

Index: 159
There are mountains to the south of my mansion.  They may be dangerous, so make sure to wear your ringmail tunic before you leave.

Index: 160
Once you find the mountains, you can mine them with your trusty shovel or pickaxe.

Index: 161
Once you have completed mining five large iron ore piles from mountains or caves, visit Uzeraan.  There are four types of ore piles, the largest pile smelts for the most ingots.

Index: 162
To mine ore, you will need to use your shovel or pickaxe on the mountainside or on a cave floor.  Double-clicking the shovel or pickaxe allows you to use the item.  You can then target the mountain or cave floor.

Index: 163
If an area is out of ore, you will need to hunt further along a mountainside or in a cave for more spots to mine at.  Simply use your digging tool on different areas of the stone until you get some ore.

Index: 164
Ore comes in varying sizes.  The smaller the pile, the fewer ingots it will make when it is smelted.  You will need five large piles of iron ore to smelt into the ingots you need.

Index: 165
Uzeraan's forge can be used to smelt ore into iron ingots.  Those ingots can be used to make tools.  Visit Uzeraan once you have completed smelting the ore.

Index: 166
Smelt ore in town at the forge for iron ingots.  Visit Uzeraan once you have completed smelting the ingots.

Index: 167
Uzeraan says: Now that you have the five piles of ore, you will need to smelt them.  The forge allows you to smelt ore.

Index: 168
Once you find the forge, double-click the piles of ore and target the red coals of the forge.  The ore will be smelted into ingots, if you are close enough to the forge.

Index: 169
When you have made the iron ingots, visit Uzeraan and he will instruct you on how to make more pickaxes.

Index: 170
Make two pickaxes for mining with your tinker kit.  Show Uzeraan a pickaxe by giving it to him.

Index: 171
Shovels and pickaxes break fairly often while mining.  This means you will need to make pickaxes with the ingots you mine up

Index: 172
To make a couple of pickaxes, you can use your tinker tools on your ingots.  Select the pickaxe from the tinker menu and it will be made from the ingots you selected.

Index: 173
You can make these pickaxes anywhere, as long as you have the ingots.  This means if you ever run out of pickaxes while mining a mountainside, you can make more pickaxes right away!

Index: 174
Make fifty iron ingots for the mansion.  Visit Uzeraan once you have completed making the ingots.

Index: 175
Uzeraan says:  Now that you know how to keep your pickaxes in good supply and how to make iron ingots, I happen to be in need of a large pile of ingots.

Index: 176
Please make fifty ingots and bring them to me.  I will buy them from you for five-hundred gold.

Index: 177
Iron ore piles are heavy.  You will need to lug piles of ore you mine back to the mansion to smelt them into iron ingots.  This may take you a few trips back and forth between the mountains and the forge.

Index: 178
Once you have completed the ingots, visit me for your payment.

Index: 179
Uzeraan describes the order deeds the armourers need in Minoc.  Find the moongate at the south-east part of town.  This moongate will take you to a location just outside of Minoc.

Index: 180
Uzeraan says: You have done very well.  You know how to supply yourself with iron ingots and pickaxes.

Index: 181
Now, I have a more advanced task for you.  The city armourers of Minoc are in need of weapons and armor.  I have placed their order deeds in your backpack for you to fulfill.

Index: 182
To get to the city of Minoc, you will need to travel through the moongate.  The moongate is located to the south-east of town, towards the mountains.

Index: 183
The moongate allows you to travel to far destinations.  Select Trammel and then Minoc and accept the menu and it will whisk you away.  Once there, walk west towards the road.

Index: 184
Now that you have found the moongate, you should walk into it.  A menu will appear asking where you wish to travel to.

Index: 185
There are two types of moongates.  Moongates, such as the one you just found, are scattered through the world and offer menus of different locations.

Index: 186
The other type of moongate does not offer a menu.  It is a moongate that powerful mages may temporarily create to allow themselves and others to pass through them to marked locations.

Index: 187
If you cannot walk into the moongate, you may double-click it to use it.  If you are too far from the moongate, you cannot use the moongate.

Index: 188
Besides allowing you to travel between locations, you may use a moongate to go to another facet.  The two facets are Felucca and Trammel.

Index: 189
The city of Haven is in Trammel.  If you wish to travel back to Haven, you would need to select Trammel before selecting it as the city you wish to visit.

Index: 190
To visit Minoc, you may visit it in either Trammel or Felucca.  Although, the armourers that need the weapons and armor are in Trammel.

Index: 191
Select Trammel as the facet you wish to visit and then select Minoc as the city.  

Index: 192
The city of Minoc is a city of miners, tinkerers, and jewelers.  Minoc is to the north-northwest.  The mountains are north-east of Minoc.  You need to complete the order deeds in Minoc.

Index: 193
Minoc is to the north-west of the gate you have just exited from.  There is a road to the west that leads north into town.

Index: 194
The armourers have two shops in town.  They both have forges and anvils in them that you can use to make the weapons and armor in your order deeds.

Index: 195
If you pass through town, the mountains are to the north-east of Minoc.  You can use those mountains to mine the ore you need for ingots and blacksmithing.

Index: 196
The grey order deeds can be double-clicked to open them up and read what the amount and type of items are needed by the armourers.  Forge the items as you did for the ringmail tunic earlier with your blacksmithy hammer.

Index: 197
Use the combine button in the opened deed window to combine your finished products with the deed.  When you have finished the amount the orders are for, drag the deed onto an armourer or blacksmith in Minoc.

Index: 198
After the deeds have all been completed, travel through the moongate to Haven and find Uzeraan.

Index: 199
Once you have completed the deeds, Uzeraan will grant you a reward.

Index: 200
Uzeraan says: Congratulations!  I got word through magical means that you had completed your task.  The armourers were extremely happy to have received their orders fulfilled.

Index: 201
You have requested to cancel your quest.  Once you have cancelled your quest, you cannot start the young player quest again.  Do you wish to cancel your quest?

Index: 202
Now I can finally return to my family.  Will you go and tell Aegis that I am free and that I did not give away the secret of the new spell.

Index: 203
I have some unfinished business before I can return home.  Fare thee well kind adventurer.

Index: 204
Be sure to take your spellbook and I would also suggest that you have at least 35 of each reagent.

Index: 205
Be sure to take your spellbook and I would also suggest that you have at least 50 of each reagent.

Index: 206
We believe the vile 'Headless' are responsible for these disappearances.

Index: 207
Go forth and kill at least 6 of these 'Headless' creatures. See if you can find any evidence of our missing men.

Index: 208
Well done! You have completed your task of slaying the 'Headless'.

Index: 209
You however, have shown great valor in your battle against the 'Headless'!

Index: 210
Well there is *ONE* way - Yes! That is it. Whilst I was installing the teleporter I marked a recall rune in the cave!

Index: 211
I can use this recall rune to transport you directly into the caverns. Alas, you must find your own way out.

Index: 212
Go and gather supplies for battle. I suggest you take your weapon, some armor and at least 25 bandages to be safe.

Index: 213
Return here when you are ready to depart and I will transport you into the caverns below the island.

Index: 214
It's a treasure map I received from a dragon tamer a long time ago. I have neither the time nor the patience to find the treasure.

Index: 215
Take the treasure map and this shovel.  Double click the treasure map, located in your pack, to see where the treasure is. X marks the spot.

Index: 216
I can teleport you close to where the treasure should be buried

Index: 217
It's North from here

Index: 218
It's North-East from here

Index: 219
It's East from here

It's South-East from there

* the magic fails *

Index: 226
an enchanted sextant

Index: 227
I'm sorry but it seems your backpack is too full to accept your reward. Come back when you have room for it.

Index: 228
To show me a pickaxe you have made, drag the pickaxe onto me and I will review your crafted pickaxe.

Index: 229
Through my magic, I was able to raise your blacksmithy skill a couple of points.

Index: 230
You need to clear some space in your backpack to continue with the quest.  Visit Uzeraan when you have more space in your backpack.

Index: 231
The treasure should be here on this island somewhere. I've also given you an enchanted sextant that will help you find your way.

Index: 232
You're standing right on top of the spot!

Index: 233
Press ALT-R to bring up your overhead map.  Then you can double click the enchanted sextant to tell you the way.

Index: 234
Take heed though, the magic of the sextant will only work for you. Don't give it away!

Index: 235
Once you have found the spot, you will need to follow these steps to bring up the treasure:

Index: 236
1. Double click your shovel

Index: 237
2. Target the Treasure map

Index: 238
3. Target the spot on the ground where the treasure is buried

Index: 239
If you are digging in the right spot, the chest will emerge, and the treasure's guardians will emerge.

Index: 240
You must slay all of the guardians before you can open the treasure chest.  Return here after you have completed the treasure hunt.

Index: 241
You have done well against the guardians of the treasure!  I feel I can entrust you with yet another quest.

Index: 242
We once used one of the caves below the island for mining purposes.

Index: 243
Return here when you are ready to depart for Moonglow.

Index: 244
Good luck, young fighter! I hope you succeed!  May the aethers have mercy on us if you do not.

Index: 245
Gather your weapon, armor and I suggest at least 30 bandages before you return.

Index: 246
Come back here after you have made the necessary arrangements and I will teleport you - providing I find the blasted rune.

Index: 247
Slay his captors and free him!  May your road to glory be paved with the blood of our oppressors.  Go now.

Index: 248
Well done young fighter! Stay on the path of virtue and glory and honor will be yours.

Index: 249
I foresee that you will become a mighty warrior.  I see fortune and glory on your path!

Index: 250
Take this magical sword.  It is a mighty fine weapon.  It will serve you well in your conquest against evil.

Index: 251
Go forth and kill at least 6 of the 'Headless' creatures. See if you can find evidence of our missing men.

Index: 252
Find and dig up the treasure.  Slay the guardians and take the booty that is rightfully yours.

Index: 253
Quest Complete!  You have found the treasure and have slain the guardians. Return to Uzeraan.

Index: 254
You have excavated the treasure. Return to Uzeraan.

Index: 255
I've given you a bag with some black, night sight potions. Drink them to see in the dark.  I've also included a few heal potions.

Index: 256
I have placed some bandages and heal potions in your pack, compliments of the villagers.

Index: 257
Are you sure you want to release your pet?

Index: 258
Your quest is complete.

Index: 259
Haven

Index: 260
You need to clear some space in your inventory to continue with the quest.  Come back here when you have more space in your inventory.

Index: 261
That's not enough my friend.  I need 75.  No less.

Index: 262
I can unfortunately not travel with you, but I have something that will help you find your way.

Index: 263
Take this enchanted sextant to help guide you on your journey back. Double click the sextant to show you the way to the nearest Moongate.

Index: 264
Once you find a Moongate, step into it and choose Moonglow as your destination.

Index: 265
The sextant refuses to be picked up by you

Index: 266
What misfortunes have befallen you that you would return without completing your task?

Index: 267
I have adjusted the magical teleporter to take you back.  Step onto the teleporter when you are ready.

Index: 268
Unfortunately, evil mages have relocated the prisoner to another camp.  Aegis has information on their whereabouts.

Index: 269
Seek out Aegis in Moonglow and see if he can transport you to the new location of his captured apprentice.

Index: 270
I have made the necessary adjustments to the Teleporter here. Step on to it when you are ready to depart.

Index: 271
On your way out, be sure to take a look at the 'Shadow Wisp' in the cage near the water fountain.

Index: 272
However, be sure to not attack the monsters in the cage as they are currently under the protection of the town guards.

Index: 273
You can find out if a creature is attackable or not by the color of their name when you look at them (single click).

Index: 274
If the name is in blue, then you may not attack them without becoming a criminal.

Index: 275
Needless to say, becoming a criminal in town will most certainly be detrimental to your health.

Index: 276
The monsters that you will encounter outside of this mansion, however will highlight grey, which means you can freely attack them.

Index: 277
Now please go. Time is short, dear friend.

Index: 278
On your way out, be sure to take a look at the 'Headless' in the cage near the water fountain

Index: 279
Please also note the blacksmith standing next to the magic teleporter. He sells armor and weapons.

Index: 280
It may be wise to purchase some equipment from him.  I would suggest armor made of ringmail and perhaps a shield.

Index: 281
Don't spend all your money on armor though, as you will no doubt at some time wish to purchase bolts of cloth for bandages.

Index: 282
Cloth can be purchased from tailors and can be cut up with scissors to create bandages.

Index: 283
Use bandages on yourself (double click bandages and target yourself) any time your hit points get too low.

Index: 284
Bandages are very cost-effective. Of course, you could also drink a healing potion (yellow) to heal your damage.

Index: 285
Potions, however, can be costly and require a free hand to drink.  Purchasing any of these items is easy.

Index: 286
Simply walk up to the appropriate vendor and say the words 'Vendor Buy', or use the vendor's context menu.

Index: 287
You have died.

Index: 288
As a ghost you can not interact with the world. You can not touch items nor can you use them.

Index: 289
You can pass through doors as though they do not exist.  However, you can not pass through walls.

Index: 290
No one can understand what you say whilst you are dead, unless they are using the 'Spirit Speak' skill to understand your words.

Index: 291
Since you are a new player, any items you had on your person at the time of your death will be in your backpack upon resurrection.

Index: 292
To be resurrected you must find a healer in town or wandering in the wilderness.  Some powerful players may also be able to resurrect you.

Index: 293
While you are still in young status, you will be transported to the nearest healer (along with your items) at the time of your death.

Index: 294
To rejoin the world of the living simply walk near one of the NPC healers, and they will resurrect you as long as you are not marked as a criminal.

Index: 295
Target the book you wish to copy.

Index: 296
That is not a book

Index: 297
You may not loot this mongbat. Find the one that took your gold.

Index: 298
This mongbat does not have your gold. You need to find the mongbat that highlights grey.

Index: 299
No one is allowed to enter this cave from here.

Index: 300
This yellow potion needs to be in your backpack before you may use it.

If you are leaving the mansion, you should learn about the Radar Map.

Index: 357
The Radar Map (or Overhead View) can be opened by pressing 'ALT-R' on your keyboard. It shows your immediate surroundings from a bird's eye view.

Index: 358
Pressing ALT-R twice, will enlarge the Radar Map a little.  The map shows you your immediate surroundings from a bird's eye view.

Index: 359
You can close the map by right clicking on it.  Use the Radar Map often as you travel throughout the world to familiarize yourself with your surroundings.

Index: 360
Why are you giving me this?  You need to make pickaxes!

Speaking of context menus, you can bring up the status of your quest by bringing up your avatar's own context menu (single left, or shift-left click yourself).

Index: 367
Choose the 'Quest Log' option, and any information pertinent to your current quest status will be shown to you.

Index: 368
To help you find the location of the treasure, you should become familiar with the Radar Map.

Index: 369
The teleporter to the caves is against the north wall of this room.

Index: 370
May good luck and fortune guide your way.

Index: 371
Once you emerge from the Moongate, the city will be roughly to the north.  It should not be difficult to find.  Find Aegis and speak with him once you are in the city..

Index: 372
Actually, before you can spend this money, you will have to take the check to a bank and cash it.

Index: 373
NPC shop keepers do not accept checks as payment.  Checks are a handy way to transport large sums of money without having to lug all that gold around.

Index: 374
Cashing a check is very easy.  All you have to do is locate a NPC Banker or Minter, walk near them and say the word 'Bank'.

Index: 375
Place the check into your bank box and double click it to cash it.  Bankers and Minters can be found inside of banks across the world.

Index: 376
There is a bank not too far from here, Southeast of this shop, actually.  Banks are often crowded with people conducting business.

Index: 377
Go now to cash your check.  The person cashing your check will explain the details of Britannia's banking system to you.

Index: 378
Ah! Thank you noble adventurer!  I have accepted your check and cashed it for you.  The cash can be found in your bank box.

Index: 379
To open your bank box, you must be near a Banker or Minter and say the word 'Bank'.

Index: 380
Of course you can also open your bank box by using a Minter's or Banker's context menu.

Index: 381
Bank boxes in Britannia are special in that the goods you place in to a bank box anywhere, can be accessed from your bank box anywhere else in the land.

Index: 382
That is to say, your bank box, along with any goods you placed into it,  is accessible from any bank in the land.

Index: 383
The safest place for any of your goods, is your bank box.  No one can access it except for you.

Index: 384
That's pretty much all there is to banking.  I bet you are eager to explore the world, so I won't hold you up any longer.

Index: 385
I've no tasks for you to complete, and you are free to adventure in the world on your own.

Index: 386
May your bank box overflow with the spoils of your adventures.  We shall no doubt see each other again.

Index: 387
Farewell.

Index: 388
Locate the bank and find the NPC Banker (or Minter) inside.  Then, say the word 'Bank' and place your check into your bank box and double click it.

Index: 389
To make it easier to find the Treasure, be sure to use your radar map.

Index: 390
To make your attack, you will most likely wish to use your magical powers, so allow me to give you a brief explanation of magic.

Index: 391
Most often, spells start out as scrolls written by either NPC or Player scribes.  Once a spell has been successfully scribed, you have two choices:

Index: 392
One: You can cast the spell by using (double click) the scroll.  No spell reagents (ingredients) are required to cast spells from scrolls. Casting from a scroll consumes the scroll.

Index: 393
Two: You can drop the scroll on to your spellbook where it will be permanently written.  You can then cast the spell from your spellbook any time you wish.

Index: 394
To cast a spell from a spellbook, the necessary reagents are required (listed with the spell in your spellbook). 

Index: 395
Casting spells from a spellbook AND casting spells from scrolls requires a certain amount of mana. The actual amount of mana required differs from circle to circle.

Index: 396
The 1st circle of spells is the easiest of spells to cast (and also has the least mana requirement) whilst 8th circle spells are difficult even for a Grandmaster Mage.

Index: 397
To actually cast a spell from your spellbook, you must first open your spellbook (double click).  This opens the book to the 1st & 2nd circle spells.

Index: 398
You can turn pages by single clicking the corner in the top right hand side of the spellbook, or you can single click on the circled numbers on the bottom to jump to specific circle.

Index: 399
You can double click any of the spell names to make an attempt at casting that spell.  To see a spell's reagent requirements, single click on the spell name.

Index: 400
Single clicking on a spell name will give you all the details of the spell.  You can see the aforementioned reagent requirements as well as the spell's icon.

Index: 401
Another way of casting a spell is to click on that spell's spell icon.  You can drag any spell's icon off of the book and place it anywhere in the game window.

Index: 402
Once a spell icon is in the game window, it will stay there even if you close the spellbook.  This is an easy way to set up many spells for quick casting.

Index: 403
Before going into battle, you should always check your reagent supply and make sure you have your spell icons set up.

Index: 404
You now have enough Mandrake in your pack to complete your task for Uzeraan.  Find Uzeraan and give him 75 mandrake roots by dragging them onto him.

Index: 405
You have enough Mandrake in your pack to complete your task for Uzeraan.  Find Uzeraan and give him 75 mandrake roots by dragging them onto him.

Index: 406
I have drawn you a picture of what the Reagent Shop sign looks like (left).   Remember that you can also look at (single click) shop signs to read them.

Index: 407
Marking runes is easy.  I'll give you a quick explanation of how it works, then I would advise that you mark a rune somewhere around my mansion so you can return quickly.

Index: 408
To mark a rune, you must stand in the place where you wish to appear when casting the 'Recall' or 'Gate' spell.

Index: 409
Then you cast the mark spell (either from a scroll or your spellbook, as I have explained earlier).  Once the spell is cast you will get a targeting cursor.

Index: 410
Target the rune you wish to mark and single click it.  If your spell is successful, the rune will sparkle and will from then on be 'marked'.

Index: 411
Looking at the rune (single click) will give you the description of the rune.  If you wish to change the default description, simply double click the rune.

Index: 412
Once you have double clicked the rune, you will get a text prompt.  Enter the new description and press the [enter] key on your keyboard.

Index: 413
By naming all of your runes to something that is meaningful to you, you can keep your rune library organized and easy to use.

Index: 417
To bring up your status bar, single click yourself and drag away from your avatar.  Double click the status bar to see details.

If your health drops too low, you should heal yourself with bandages or healing potions.  Heal yourself often, and you should have no trouble surviving.

Index: 419
One more thing before you depart for battle:

Index: 420
You have found a Moongate.  Remember to choose 'Moonglow' as your destination when you step into the gate.

Index: 421
Moonglow is where Aegis is waiting for you in his shop.

Index: 422
Congratulations! You've completed all of your quests!

Index: 423
I can open a Moongate for you from here to an area close to the Moongate that can take you to the city of Moonglow.

Index: 424
I only have runes marked for near the Moongate, but the sextant will help you find the rest of the way.

Index: 425
Aegis' Shop

Index: 426
I have drawn you a picture to the left of what the sign on Aegis' Shop looks like. It should help you find it a little easier.

Index: 427
You do not have enough reagents to safely go on.  You should acquire at least 35 of each reagent.

Index: 428
There are 8 types of reagent: Mandrake, Nightshade, Black Pearl, Sulfurous Ash, Spider's Silk, Garlic, Ginseng and Bloodmoss.

Index: 429
The caves tend to be dark, so be sure to cast the 'Night Sight' spell on yourself if you have trouble seeing.

Index: 56
Through my magic, I was able to raise your blacksmithy skill a couple points.  Now, I would like to let you take some time to put your goods in the bank. The bank is right next to the mansion to the southeast.

Ah! Thank you noble adventurer!  I have accepted your check and cashed it for you.  The cash can be found in your bank box.

Of course you can also open your bank box by using a Minter's or Banker's context menu.

Index: 61
Bank boxes in Britannia are special in that the goods you place into a bank box anywhere can be accessed from your bank box anywhere else in the land.

Index: 62
The safest place for any of your goods is your bank box.  No one can access your bank box except for you.

Index: 63
After you have finished depositing items in your bank, visit Uzeraan for a pack horse.

Index: 64
Uzeraan explains how to use a pack horse.  Take your pack horse to mountains south of Uzeraan's castle.

Index: 65
Pack horses are used to carry large quantities of items that you normally could not fit in your backpack.  Miners use them for carrying large quantities of ore, ingots, and some tools.

Index: 66
Pack horses are loyal to their masters unless they are not fed.  Apples or pears are foods that the pack horses appreciate and will keep them loyal.

Index: 67
Once you have renamed your pack horse, you can have your pet obey commands.  The most common commands are 'follow me' and 'stay'.  However, your pet must be in range to hear you.

Index: 68
All pets you own can be renamed.  Click and hold the left mouse button on the pack horse and drag its health bar.

Index: 69
Try walking away from your pack horse and tell it to follow you by left-clicking on the pack horse and select the command 'follow'.

Index: 70
To get your pet to stay, you would tell it to stay by left-clicking on the pack horse and select the command 'stay' from the command list.

Index: 71
Mine 40 piles of ore from the mountains and use your pack horse to haul the piles of ore.  Visit Uzeraan at his mansion once you have the 40 piles of ore.

Index: 72
Now that you know how to handle your pack horse, use your new pack horse to haul 40 large piles of ore from the mountains.  You will need to tinker a couple more shovels to be able to mine the ore.

Index: 73
You can double-click on your pack horse to open its backpack.  While open, you can load your pack horse by dropping items into its backpack.

Index: 74
Uzeraan encourages you to practice to 70 skill in blacksmithy.  You do not have to train immediately.  When you have reached 70 skill, visit Uzeraan.

Index: 75
Uzeraan says: Congratulations!  You have mastered the basics of mining and blacksmithy.  I am giving you 500 gold for your ore.  You may keep your pack horse.

Index: 76
Now that you have accomplished so much, you should train your blacksmithy skill so you may perform a more difficult task.  It may take some time to train to 70 skill.  I have a task to ask of you when you have finished training.

Index: 77
You do not need to hurry out and train.  The world is waiting to be explored and some adventurers may need your skills.  Come visit me when you have trained to 70 skill (or higher).

Index: 78
Now that you are an accomplished blacksmith, Uzeraan has another set of orders the armourers of Minoc would like you to fulfill.  Once completed, give them to an armourer or blacksmith in the city of Minoc.

Index: 79
Uzeraan says: Ah, I see that you are well on your way to mastering blacksmithy.  I have four order deeds that the armourers would like you to fulfill in Minoc.

Index: 80
One of the deeds is the large order, which must be combined to completed order deeds.  The three smaller deeds are for chainmail.

Index: 81
Combine the items requested in the order with the small deed.  Once the deed is completed, you can use the large order deed to combine with a smaller deed.

Index: 82
The large order deed, when it is filled with all of the small deeds, would then be dropped onto an armourer or blacksmith in Minoc.  They will make sure your goods go to those in need.

Index: 83
Visit Uzeraan once you have completed the orders for the armourers of Minoc.

Index: 84
Mastering blacksmithy

Index: 85
Now that you have helped the blacksmiths of Minoc, you have proved your worthiness of mastering blacksmithy.

To check your health, single left-click + drag away from your avatar. This brings up your status bar. 

Index: 90
Double click the status bar to see detailed information. Check your hitpoints and determine if you would like to heal yourself at this point or not. 

Index: 91
To heal yourself you may use bandages (double click bandages and target yourself) or drink a heal potion (free one of your hands and double click the potion).

Index: 92
Alternatively, if you know your way around spellbooks and such, you can cast the Heal or Greater Heal spells to recover lost hitpoints.

Index: 93
You have slain the leader of the pack.

Index: 94
Be sure to check his corpse (double click) for the red box which holds the key to the cage in which the apprentice is being held.

Index: 95
Cast the Unlock spell on the red box to open the lock.

Index: 96
Open (double click) the red box and find the key inside. Take the key (drag and drop into your pack).

Index: 97
Use the key (double click) and target the door on the prison cage. This will unlock the door.

Index: 98
Now you can open the door (double click) to free the apprentice.

Find the High Mage <I>Schmendrick</I> in the mines and recover the scroll of power from him.

Index: 322
<I>Schmendrick barely pays you any attention as you approach him.  His mind seems to be occupied with something else.  You explain to him that you came for the scroll of power and after a long while he begins to speak, but apparently still not giving you his full attention...</I><BR><BR>Hmmm.. peculiar indeed.  Very strange activity here indeed... I wonder...<BR><BR>Hmmm.  Oh yes! Scroll, you say?  I don't have it, sorry. My apprentice was carrying it, and he ran off to somewhere in this cave.  Find him and you will find the scroll.<BR><BR>Be sure to bring the scroll to Uzeraan once you have it. He's the only person aside from myself who can read the ancient markings on the scroll.  I need to figure out what's going on down here before I can leave.  Strange activity indeed...<BR><BR><I>Schmendrick goes back to his work and you seem to completely fade from his awareness...

Index: 323
Find Schmendrick's apprentice who is somewhere in the mining cave.  The apprentice has the scroll of power needed by Uzeraan.

Index: 324
You have obtained the scroll of power!  Find your way out of the cave.<BR><BR>Hand the scroll to Uzeraan (drag and drop) once you arrive in his mansion.

Index: 325
<I>Uzeraan carefully unravels the scroll and begins to read...after a short while his face lights up with a smile and he speaks to you...</I><BR><BR>This is wonderful, friend!  For your troubles I've given you a treasure map I had laying about, along with a shovel to <a href = "?ForceTopic91">dig up the treasure</a>.  Feel free to find the treasure at your leisure.<BR><BR>Now let us get back to the business of this scroll. The only trouble, is that this scroll calls for some special ingredients that I do not have on hand.<BR><BR>Though it may involve some danger, I will ask of you to find these reagents for me.  <BR><BR>There are three reagents I need to complete the spell.<BR><BR>The first thing I need is some <I>Fertile Dirt</I>.<BR><BR>There lives a Dryad on this island who I know would have such a thing on hand.  I have recalibrated the teleporter to transport you to the Dryad's grove, which lies <a href = "?ForceTopic13">South-West</a> of this mansion.<BR><BR>Tell her Uzeraan sent you, and she should cooperate.<BR><BR>Should you get into trouble out there or should you lose your way, do not worry.  I have also given you a magical horn - a <I>Horn of Retreat</I>.  Play the horn at any time to open a magical gateway that leads back to this mansion.<BR><BR>Should your horn run out of <a href = "?ForceTopic83">charges</a>, simply hand me or any of my mansion guards the horn to have it recharged.<BR><BR>Good luck friend.

Index: 326
<I>The Dryad watches hungrily as you approach, giving you an uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach.  You explain that Uzeraan has sent you for a quantity of fertile dirt.  With a wide grin and in a slightly hoarse voice she replies...</I><BR><BR><I>Fertile Dirt</I>, eh?  Well, I have a few patches here...but what have you brought me in return?  Came empty-handed did you?  That's unfortunate indeed... but since you were sent by my dear friend Uzeraan, I supposed I could oblige you.<BR><BR><I>The Dryad digs around in the ground and hands you a patch of Fertile Dirt.<BR><BR>With a smile she goes back to her work...</I>

Index: 327
You have acquired the <I>Fertile Dirt</I>!<BR><BR>Return to the mansion (<a href = "?ForceTopic13">North-East</a> of the Dryad's Grove) and hand it to Uzeraan.

Index: 328
NullString.

Index: 329
<I>Uzeraan takes the dirt from you and smiles...<BR><BR></I>Wonderful!  I knew I could count on you.  As a token of my appreciation I've given you a bag with some bandages as well as some healing potions.  They should help out a bit.<BR><BR>The next item I need is a <I>Vial of Blood</I>.  I know it seems strange, but that's what the formula asks for.  I have some locked away in a chest not far from here.  It's only a short distance from the mansion.  Let me give you directions...<BR><BR>Exit the front door to the East.  Then follow the path to the North.  You will pass by several pedestals with lanterns on them.  Continue on this path until you run into a small hut.  Walk up the stairs and through the door.  Inside you will find a chest.  Open it and bring me a <I>Vial of Blood</I> from inside the chest.  It's very easy to find.  Just follow the road and you can't miss it.<BR><BR>Good luck!

Index: 330
You have been ambushed! Fight for your honor!!!

Index: 331
You take a vial of blood from the chest and put it in your pack.

Index: 332
You have the vial of blood!<BR><BR>Return to Uzeraan's mansion and hand him the vial.

Index: 333
<I>You hand Uzeraan the Vial of Blood, which he hastily accepts...</I><BR><BR>Excellent work!  Only one reagent remains and the spell is complete!  The final requirement is a <I>Daemon Bone</I>, which will not be as easily acquired as the previous two components.<BR><BR>There is a haunted graveyard on this island, which is the home to many undead creatures.   Dispose of the undead as you see fit.  Be sure to search their remains after you have smitten them, to check for a <I>Daemon Bone</I>.  I'm quite sure that you will find what we seek, if you are thorough enough with your extermination.<BR><BR>Take this magical silver sword to aid you in your battle.  Silver weapons will damage the undead twice as much as your regular weapon.<BR><BR>Return here when you have found a <I>Daemon Bone</I>.

Index: 334
Head <a href = "?ForceTopic13">East</a> of here (or use the Horn of Retreat) to return to Uzeraan's Mansion and deliver the bone to Uzeraan.

Index: 335
<I>As you hand Uzeraan the final reagent, he nods at you with approval and starts searching through the pockets of his robe...<BR><BR>After a short while he hands you a small pouch...</I><BR><BR>There you are.  Your contract of employment with me has expired and so here is your pay.  2000 gold in the form of a check and a magical sextant that will help you find <a href = "?ForceTopic47">Moongates</a> and Banks.<BR><BR>Before you can actually spend the money I have given you, however, you must <a href="?ForceTopic86">cash the check</a>.<BR><BR>I have recalibrated the teleporter to take you to the Haven <a href="?ForceTopic38">Bank</a>.  Step onto the teleporter to be taken to the bank, which lies <a href = "?ForceTopic13">South-West</a> of here.<BR><BR>Thank you for all your help friend.  I hope we shall meet each other again in the future.<BR><BR>Farewell.

Index: 336
Locate the Haven Bank (use the teleporter in Uzeraan's Mansion if necessary), which lies <a href = "?ForceTopic13">South-West</a> of Uzeraan's Mansion.  Once there, <a href="?ForceTopic86">cash your check</a>.

Index: 337
<I>The banker smiles at you and greets you in a loud and robust voice...</I><BR><BR>Well hello there adventurer!  I see you've learned how to cash checks.  Wonderful!  Let me tell you a bit about the banks in this world...<BR><BR>Anything that you place into any bank box, can be retrieved from any other bank box in the land.  For instance, if you place an item into a bank box in Haven, it can be retrieved from your bank box in Britain or any other city.<BR><BR> Bank boxes are very secure.  So secure, in fact, that no one can ever get into your bank box except for yourself.  Security is hard to come by these days, but you can trust in the banking system of Britannia!  We shall not let you down! <BR><BR>I hope to be seeing much more of you as your riches grow!  May your bank box overflow with the spoils of your adventures.<BR><BR>Farewell adventurer, you are now free to explore the world on your own.

Youthful Treasuremaps

Index: 550
Treasure maps are pieces of paper that will show the location of a buried treasure somewhere in the land.<BR><BR>To find this treasure, a few simple steps must be followed.<BR><BR><U>1.</U> Use the <a href = "?90">context menu</a> on the map to decode the map. Once a map is decoded, it will no longer have the word "tattered" in it's title.  This is a handy thing to know if you want to find out if a map has been previously decoded or not.  This is important, since only the person that decoded the map, can actually dig up the treasure.<BR><BR><U>2.</U> Finding the treasure is a rather simple procedure on youthful treasuremaps.  You will need some sort of digging device (like a shovel or a pickaxe) to unearth the treasure.  Once you have secured your tools, you will need to open the map (double click) and take a look at it.  Use your <a href = "?14">Radar Map</a> to see if you can somewhat figure out where the treasure might be by comparing the drawing on the map and the picture from the the overhead Radar.<BR><BR>If you are having trouble making out the area,  the best thing to do is to find a patch of grass or dirt (out in the woods perhaps), and start digging.  Digging is easily accomplished by using the "Dig for Treasure" <a href = "?90">context menu</a> on the map.<BR><BR>Once you select the digging option, target the place on the ground that you wish to dig at.  If you are not at the correct spot, you will get help message telling you which direction to move in.  Follow the directions and keep digging until you find the chest.<BR><BR><U>3.</U> Once the chest has emerged, the treasure's guardians will appear.  You must defeat all of the treasure's guardians before you can loot the chest.<BR><BR>Good luck.

Target any rune (which can be <a href = "?33">purchased</a> from most magic shops) to <i>mark</i> that rune with your current location.  If the spell is successful, the rune will be permanently marked.  You can mark over an already marked rune, which replaces your new location with the old location.<BR><BR>Once a rune is marked, you can use either the <a href = "?94">Recall</a> or the <a href = "?96">Gate</a> spell to travel back to the marked location, instantaneously.

The gate will remain open only for a few moments before it closes again.  Anyone wishing to travel through the gate, need only to walk into the gate and they will be transported. <BR><BR>As long as your pets are following you, they too will be transported when they walk into a gate.

Condemnation will affect all houses on all shards (except in the case of a transfer or newly placed house, in which case the last house that was acquired will not be condemned, but rather will enter into the <I>Automatic</I> refresh state. See below for details.).<BR><BR>Although the contents of a condemned house are still accessible as they normally would, the house cannot be refreshed.  In addition to not being refreshable, the house will collapse within 2 days of being condemned.  If a house entered the <I>condemned</I> status because the house owner's account became inactive, the house(s) may be uncondemned by the house owner, by openeing the front door.  Otherwise, the house can only be uncondemned by transferring or re-deeding it.<BR><BR><U>Grandfathered</U><BR><BR>These houses will be need to be manually refreshed by the house owner, one of the co-owners or house friends.

Followers

Followers are pets, hirelings, and constructs under your control.  They are gained in a variety of different ways, including Animal Taming, trading, crafting, or just handing a pile of gold to an out-of-work mercenary.  All players may have up to five followers.  On top of this, some individual followers may count as more than one follower.  For example, a dragon counts as three followers, a hireling counts as two, and a horse counts as one.  This means you could have a dragon and two horses, or two mercenaries and one horse, or any combination thereof.<br><br>Note: Some powerful creatures, such as dragons, also require Animal Taming and Animal Lore to control, regardless of the number of followers you have.
